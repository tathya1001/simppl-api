tzaeru,"The naturalization of nationalism, the lack of words, and banal nationalism","Something I've somewhere mused earlier, but was reminded of it due to this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/1iqj3pa/in\_light\_of\_trumps\_recent\_tweet/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/1iqj3pa/in_light_of_trumps_recent_tweet/)

Nationalism, originally, meant the movement that saw national identity as something that ought to be the basis for the state; for each nation, there is one state, and for each state, there's a primary nation.

It presupposes both the existence of states and the existence - and importance - of a consistent experience of a national identity.

Nowadays, nationalism is more or less a negative term. It is mainly understood as meaning people who are particularly nationalist, typically in a way that sees to openly value their own nationality above others.

Yet, nationalism is in truth extremely prevalent, across almost the whole political spectrum, and on every level in society. People ask a foreign-seeming person where they come from to learn their *true* nationality, everyone must have a nationality associated with them in our record-keeping systems, rhetoric drawing from nationalism is prevalent among all parliamentary politics no matter the party (""We fight for the brighter future for Americans!"", a statement basically any American politician could put out).

Nationalism has become so internalized and so presupposed and so naturalized that there isn't even a word left to describe it.

That, to me, is alarming and sad. For that to change, somehow, it should be once again made obvious that chauvinist nationalism and this sort of ""hidden"", everyday, unnamed nationalism are basically simply the same thing of different strengths.

Michael Billig coined the term ""banal nationalism"" for this. But I doubt that's a term that's going to see much use; *banal* is also negative.

Instead, what I think might be good would be to just commonly and often call this out as what it is - nationalism. No tippy-toeing, if an argument or a rhetoric or a phrase is rooted in nationalist thinking or presupposes nation states, we call it what it is - nationalism.",27,0.91,10,1739718068,Anarchism

NoExceptions1312,anarcho-communism is not a real thing,"Why do so many modern anarchists conflate anarchism with socialism, marxism, and communism? Historically, anarchist thinkers like Proudhon, Bakunin, and Kropotkin were opposed to marxism, not aligned with it. Bakunin, for example, saw Marx’s “dictatorship of the proletariat” as just another form of authoritarianism that would inevitably lead to oppression—something history proved correct.

The term anarcho-communism comes largely from Kropotkin, but when he (and other 19th-century thinkers) used the word “communism,” they were describing a hypothetical stateless society—one that had never existed. After the Russian Revolution, communism became a concrete, real-world system associated with centralized authoritarian states like the Soviet Union. So why are people still using the term anarcho-communism today, when communism now represents state control and authoritarianism? It’s completely contradictory to attach anarchism—a philosophy of anti-authoritarianism—to a term that has become synonymous with government control.

The reality is that modern leftist and activist groups have co-opted anarchism, blending it into a vague, trendy brand of “anti-capitalism” that serves their own agenda. They take the aesthetics of rebellion while injecting anarchism with socialist and marxist ideas—ideologies that are inherently dependent on centralized power and state control. But true anarchism is diametrically opposed to socialism and marxism because those ideologies require a governing force, whether it’s a state or a so-called “people’s collective.” Anyone claiming to be an anarchist while advocating for socialism or marxism is either deeply misinformed or deliberately misleading.

As I said in the last writing, South Korea is a bad place for organizing as a libertarian socialist. Most of my compatriots think that **socialism = communism = Stalinism = North Korea = dictatorship = totalitarianism**, and if you talk about ""organizing to implement socialism"", they would likely think of North Korea, CCP, or Khmer Rouge.

  
However, I've thought of another way to work for libertarian socialism without organizing. The idea was, **YouTube**. Since YouTube is a well-known platform for Koreans, I can introduce anarchism and libertarianism to Koreans, without having to organize with others!

  
So, I asked permission for[ a foreign YouTuber](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDnenjIdnnE), and he gladly let me translate the video. The outcome, was, [**THIS**](https://youtu.be/qLSE6-IWu4Y)!

\-Makhnovshchina, Kronstadt Rebellion, Korean People's Association in Manchuria, and CNT-FAI

\-New Left and Revolution in 1968, particularly Black Panther Party

\-Feminist works promoted by PKK &amp; YPG/YPJ (Kurdish), Dawronoye (Syriac/Assyrian), SDF, etc.

\-Antifa movements in the Western world

\-Anything else!

  
I would be more than glad if you come up with a good idea on my works.

Art-X-,Cultural anthropology's place on the map to true democracy,"Cultural anthropology in a nutshell: Human life occurs in group realities, lived systems of concepts and practices, meanings and activities, that lay out the structures and contents of worlds of experience.

The worlds of experience built out of meanings and practices that we occupy and enact include forms of agency and personhood, general structures of intention and desire, general conceptions of self and others, and the social and physical terrain of everyday life.

We are socialized into group realities, with their particular systems of concepts and practices, which we then produce and reproduce as we enact ourselves and live our everyday lives using the available symbolic and material resources.

Sociocultural realities (group enactments of worlds of experience and practice) are potentially (and usually) constituted with various forms of inequality and domination built in. Building inequality into daily life generally benefits the privileged by making it hard to see from the inside, where the inequality may appear “natural.” Thus, people can enact inequality, as either privileged or subordinated, as they enact everyday life, without being fully aware of what they are doing.  
  
Anthropology raises (but mostly avoids addressing too clearly) the question of what we can do about the realities we live in. Does having a good higher-order theory of human reality, language, and power enable us to develop a better ‘language-practice’ that could facilitate the construction of better realities, based not on power concentration but on democracy, freedom, time, love, or whatever other values groups of like-minded people decide are best for them at any given moment? I don’t see any good reason not to be optimistic, to believe (even as faith if necessary, as it probably is) that groups of humans acting in good will have the capacity — the freedom and the ability — to create much much better ways of living than we’ve got going now.

Big-Investigator8342,How influential is the Durruti Group's updated anarchism on anarchists in the west?,"
This version keeps the revolutionary tone and key terminology while avoiding terms that could be get it taken down. I had to run the old words of the durruti group through a PC AI to soften and tone down the 1930s anarchist lanuage to  be more sensitive and anti-oppressive ironically.

The collapse of an anarchist revolution that had everything in its favor was a pivotal moment. The Durruti group identified key structural weaknesses and sought to address them to prevent similar failures in future anarchist movements.

They followed apolitical theories to their logical conclusion and recognized a critical issue: the absence of political decision-making structures necessary for the coordination necessary to sustain the revolution.

In 1938, they proposed a program with a strategic adjustment to anarchism. How influential have their insights and warnings been on contemporary 21st-century anarchist thought in the West?

Our Programme
Revolutions cannot succeed without clear objectives and direction. The July Revolution demonstrated this shortcoming—while the CNT had the strength, it lacked a cohesive plan to channel revolutionary energy. Leaders were caught off guard and uncertain about how to proceed. The result was hesitation at a moment when decisive action was essential, ultimately leading to the revolution’s loss.

These critical junctures leave no room for uncertainty. There must be a clear path forward. We aim to address this gap, ensuring that the lessons of July and May are never repeated.

To this end, we propose a strategic modification to anarchism: the establishment of a Revolutionary Junta.

The revolution requires organized bodies to oversee and defend it against hostile elements. Experience has shown that opposition will not simply fade away—it must be confronted. While some anarchist comrades may have ideological concerns, the reality of events demands that we take a firm stance.

If we wish to avoid repeating past mistakes, we must act decisively against forces that do not align with the interests of the working class.

Key Proposals:
1. Establishment of a Revolutionary Junta or National Defense Council.

This body will be formed through democratic elections within union organizations. Consideration will be given to those at the front, ensuring their right to representation.
The Junta will not interfere in economic matters, which remain under union control.
Functions of the Junta include:
Coordinating defense and managing the war effort.
Maintaining revolutionary stability.
Handling international affairs.
Conducting revolutionary outreach.
Positions will rotate regularly to prevent entrenchment, with trade union assemblies exercising oversight.
2. Economic Power to the Syndicates.

Since July, unions have demonstrated their ability to manage economic production effectively. Their role must be fully recognized and elevated.
An Economic Council, aligned with industrial federations, may be established to enhance coordination.
3. Free Municipality.

Before foreign rule, Spain had a strong tradition of municipal autonomy. This decentralized model must be revived to prevent the formation of a new state system.
In the new society, governance will be handled by local municipalities, supported by unions. Since all members of society will be producers, there will be no inherent conflicts of interest.
Municipalities will be organized into local, regional, and national federations, maintaining strong ties with the unions at every level.

AdventurousAverage11,I Can't Find Hope in Anarchy,"I'm two years out of highschool and studying at a community college. My father has been a blue collar worker his whole life and made it known to me that I'll regret it if I led the life he did in construction, and in the mill. Every since 9th grade, though I was slightly conservative then, I despised the idea of work. Not work in itself, but a life of work, because to me life felt antithetical to it. Now, as I'm receiving an education, I feel more and more despair reading the news and seeing the state of the world. Reading history of stateless and/or horizontal societies don't bring me much hope either. I just want to live in a world where whatever work I do feels important, like it fulfills a purpose, as this one makes it feel almost worthless. 

Today I was planning to join a group reading, at a local anarchist collective (unlucky, an ice storm hit), but mostly for finding community. I suppose the point of this post is that I'm feeling anarchism, or any other anti-capitalist movement for that matter, is a lost cause considering how dominant our economic and political structures are. Learning about the world only depresses me more. So, why should I feel anarchism will gain any wider engagement, or at least enough to be effective? After all, if we did we would surely be warred against until we had no capacity to serve ourselves.

I want to be hopeful, maybe, at the very least, I will help a movement persist beyond my own life. As AI progresses, however, it feels as if the rich (who have exclusive control over its use) will dictate the course of history just as before.

But I’m wondering if there’s lefty philanthropists or micro grants or really anything else I could tap into.

handsomedad,"Living a meaningful, anarchist life vs. privilege","Hi everyone.  I hope this post finds you well and with some nourishment and loved ones bringing colour into your life.  I wanted to inquire with this sub about some existential questions I am having regarding my own life path, and I guess a request for some advice.

I am a white settler (30m) currently living in a city where I've been for the past 6 years.  I was not born here but I have developed many good relationships here with people, projects, and the land.  I spent my first 4 years here involved in activism and advocacy, particularly regarding housing justice, until I 'burned out' and my energy output became unsustainable.  Since that time two years ago, I've been struggling to reorient my life path towards meaningful, longterm projects.  The reality of rent, food prices, traffic congestion, etc. is, of course, fairly suffocating. I have found my own ways to manage but systemically I don't have faith in things getting better.

Presently, I have some good friends living in a rural area 2 hours from the city, who would gladly welcome me into their community.  Most amenities are 15-45 minutes away but there is plentiful access to land, and good soil for farming/gardening.  I have access to an offgrid land project with dear friends where we could live ruggedly and supporting one another.  There are many enticing things about this rural life: the directness of growing my own food, fetching my own water, firewood, building structures from scraps, doing all of this with friends. But I have some hangups.  Namely, I feel that I would be ""cashing in"" on my whiteness and intergenerational wealth in a way that compromises my values, i.e. prioritizing my own comfort over vulnerable strangers, inevitably dedicating a higher proportion time &amp; energy to off-grid chores, driving, etc.  Of course there would be the possibility of developing more relationships with locals and creating mutual aid projects.  And even though it is a very white region, there are historic Black and Indigenous communities \~30-40 minutes away that I could develop more of a relationship with. Ultimately, I'm struggling to shake the idea that ""the city"" is where I should be because of it's density of ""important frontlines of social struggle,"" and I also really enjoy its internationalist nature, density of young people, sometimes night-life...

Perhaps my internal conflict of ""anarchism in the city vs. the country"" is unnecessarily dualistic, yet it feels true that they are very different lifestyles.   With the reduced stress of living rurally (rent-free baby!) I would enjoy dedicating more time to writing, researching, and possibly even publishing anarchist histories.  Other than that I don't exactly have a skilled trade, but I have made myself handy for carpentry &amp; construction jobs in the past.

Any resources, insights, or experiences you feel compelled to share would be greatly beneficial to me.  I appreciate you taking time to read this.  In solidarity !",1,1,1,1739296587,Anarchism
Mysterious_Clock_943,"Neurodivergent, disabled, care leaver and youth anarchist trapped in academia: an italian educational odyssey","""TL;DR: I need formal education and credentials to survive and eventually reform/overthrow the system, but I deeply oppose its reductionist, oppressive, and anti-neurodivergent approach. I want libertarian education that embraces doubt, critical thinking, and diverse ways of knowing. Currently trapped between institutional survival and my anarchist epistemology, looking for perspectives on navigating this contradiction without losing myself in the process.""

I've been doing exhausting research and reading several posts about education in this subreddit.

I'm new here and I'm mainly looking for like-minded people, who are so rare to meet in Italy.

I've always been an unorthodox student. I live in Italy, I'm autistic and gifted, and I live with a chronic disabling condition. I have no family. My autistic condition has made me particularly devoted to science, and over the years my reflections and way of thinking have naturally drawn me closer to anarchist thought, particularly its ecological and communitarian current. Perhaps I'm more anarchist than I realize!

Throughout my life journey, I have experienced systematic discrimination and abuse, istitutional too: at university, in high school, and in the communities where I lived as a minor. My unconventional way of thinking, giftedness, political practices, and specific needs related to my atypicality were certainly catalyzing elements of these experiences of marginalization and violence. These continuous social pressure and discrimination have led me to develop deep depression.

I consider anarchism as a possible foundation for an ethical epistemological paradigm that aspires to overcome fragmented, reductionist knowledge. My passion for study and reading, which I experience as acts of subversion, has progressively distanced me from contemporary institutions. In ten years of professional experience across public, private, cooperatives, and NGOs, I have observed how neoliberal ideology and kyriarchy have corrupted ideals, principles, and projects at every level, especially in Italy.

Currently, I do a job I love - I dedicate myself, besides obsessive studying, to advocacy and support for young people who grew up without families - but it's economically undervalued. I live in poverty. In our country, which I deeply love for its language, food, climate, and geography, working conditions for neurodivergent and disabled people are extremely problematic. I also strongly oppose English as a lingua franca (I'm sorry for native-english), both for socio-political reasons and due to my neurodivergent needs. Therefore, leaving Italy is not the most immediate option for me.

I've enrolled in university to continue my studies, but I'm increasingly convinced that mass education pursues objectives far from learning quality and the development of critical thinking and autonomy - fundamental elements for forming individuals capable of contributing to their own, their community and nature's well-being. The degree appears increasingly necessary, but the meritocratic competition for scholarships, combined with the self-referential nature of the Italian system, requires conforming one's cognitive processes to a pathological system and assimilating beliefs that don't belong to me. The elimination of doubt in institutions, evidently considered subversive, is another significant issue.

My purpose is to conduct research in the sociology of institutionalized knowledge and in epistemic justic to overturn my country's educational system. I strongly believe that the way to an anti-oppressive and equitable society parts of education. However, to gain acknowledgment, credentials, and economic support (just enough to survive, haha), I must follow the institutional path.

How can I overcome this impasse?",34,0.85,12,1739286867,Anarchism

Me: ""Well, no.""

Friend: ""But if they are trying to break down all of these various government programs and remove regulations and restrictions, isn't this in line with your worldview as an anarchist?""

Me: ""No, and let me explain. First, not every anarchist would agree with me, but I would hope most would. Second, Trump and Musk are not tearing down the government completely, they are tearing down the things standing in the way of their ability to amass more power and more money. Third, Anarchy is not a top-down process. Without the bottom up approach where communities are built upon mutual trust and mutual aid, the swift removal of parts of the US government can only lead to greater chaos. With the bottom up approach, communities learn to work together in mutually beneficial ways, cooperating for the benefit of all and removing their reliance on corporations and governments. Governments would dissolve because there is no need for them, corporations would dissolve because they would be replaced by individuals cooperating for the benefit of all. Anarchism, despite popular belief, is not synonymous with chaos, and what Trump and Musk are doing is simply causing chaos for the sake of a fascist power grab.""

This is a watered down and simplified version of the exchange, but I'm curious if you all agree, or what your thoughts are on the current actions being taken to reduce many aspects of the American government by Trump and his team.",64,0.96,34,1739228709,Anarchism

Aleor_28,"Is ""fascism"" still a relevant category for political analysis today?","Hi everyone, I’d like to start a discussion about the use of the term *fascism* and whether it remains a useful category for analyzing contemporary political phenomena from an anarchist perspective.

In many political debates today, especially within antifascist circles, the term *fascism* is frequently used to describe authoritarian right-wing projects and figures such as Trump, Bolsonaro, or Elon Musk. However, I wonder if this usage is still analytically helpful or if, on the contrary, it oversimplifies the issue and prevents a deeper understanding.

**Personally, I believe that antifascism as an ethical horizon will always be relevant.** However, labeling figures like Musk or Trump as ""fascist"" seems problematic to me. Even if they share authoritarian and reactionary elements, applying this label often turns them into mere *Hollywood villains*, making it easier for them to reject the accusation and weaken the critique. Additionally, this broad use of *fascism* may prevent us from identifying the specific characteristics of today’s political and economic landscape, such as **corporate capitalism** or **techno-feudalism**.

Authors like **Murray Bookchin, Peter Gelderloos, and Noam Chomsky** have criticized the indiscriminate use of the term *fascism*, arguing that applying it to any contemporary form of authoritarianism can be misleading. Instead, they suggest analyzing power structures within capitalism, colonialism, and broader hierarchical systems. (**Edit: I originally made a mistake regarding Chomsky. In fact, he does use the term** ***fascism*** **quite broadly. Thanks to a response from DvD\_Anarchist on this post, I can now clarify this.**)

Some questions I’d like to explore:

* To what extent does *fascism*, in its historical sense (Mussolini, Hitler, etc.), remain a valid category for understanding today’s authoritarianism?
* Does the overuse of *fascism* reduce complex political phenomena to historical comparisons instead of analyzing them in their own context?
* From an anarchist perspective, is it more useful to focus on power structures and hierarchy in general rather than labeling certain movements as ""fascist""?
* What do you think of the critiques from Bookchin, Gelderloos, and Chomsky on this topic? Are there other anarchist thinkers who address this issue?

I’d love to hear your thoughts and any relevant bibliography on the subject. Thanks!",20,0.67,69,1739128007,Anarchism

I was working towards a degree in Horticulture before 2020, and now that I'm in the industry I see that horticulture is just training for industrialized farming practices. Are there any colleges that offer degrees in sustainable and truely valuable subjects? Should I just finish this degree course and then go find something more suited to my interests?

If your advice is skip the college bit, please offer a job idea or a concept to replace it because I'm good at school, and need more documented experience in something besides landscaping/greenhouse management to get a job doing something meaningful.

truth14ful,3 reasons privacy is worth taking back,"Despair is just the long way to apathy.

That's one of the biggest tricks that centers of power use to silence dissent and stop any action against them: Deny that a problem exists until it's so obvious and so bad that nobody can ignore it, and then say there's nothing we can do at this point, so why bother? We've seen this happen with capitalism and the record-breaking difference between the rich and poor, we've seen it with climate change, and we've seen it with the loss of our privacy. Right now - especially in the US - it seems like there's more interest in internet privacy than there's been in a long time, but when people look into it and find out how far we are from being truly private, they get discouraged. We're being pulled in 2 different directions: ""We can't really do anything"" and ""We can't just do nothing.""

If that's how you feel, you're not alone. But your privacy is definitely still worth taking back.

#1. Surveillance isn't free.

Corporations and governments have a lot of money, energy, and computing power to track people, but it's not infinite. The most intensive types of surveillance (the ones that involve dedicated experts, complex deanonymization techniques, and things like that) are mostly saved for high-level targets like terrorists and military agents. The basic level of surveillance they do on everyone is all passive: automatically logging information about you as you live your life.

Anything you do to separate yourself from their trackers stops a little of that. Doing something as simple as switching your browser to a more private one, or disabling location or Google apps on your phone, or deleting apps you don't need and logging out of social media, means 1 less source of information about your life that can be tracked.

Are more serious measures worth learning and doing? Absolutely, because privacy is freedom. The more dissenting, threatening to power, or targeted you are, the more private you need to be. But it's not all-or-nothing, and you can get better at it over time.

Especially because of the second reason:

#2. Information goes out of date.

It's a common belief that once your information is out there, there's no use protecting it. But almost everything about you changes over time, so if someone stops being able to track you, eventually what they know about you will be less useful. Maybe you don't go to the same places or talk to the same people as you used to. Maybe your beliefs and opinions changed. Maybe you have a different job, a different computer or phone, a different bank account or card than you did before. For all they know, maybe you changed your name and moved out of the country. Each piece of information you keep someone from getting is information that might not be true anymore.

One big exception is your DNA, which is why everyone should stay away from things like 23andMe and Ancestry.

#3. Privacy is a community effort.

Staying private would be impossible if you were the only one doing it. If everyone is leaving their data out in the open and you're the only one keeping it secret, you'll stand out more than anyone else - but if everyone is securing their privacy, it's there for people who need it most. And secure messages, group chats, and file sharing are only secure if *everyone* keeps that information safe.

Plus, privacy is only accessible because of open-source projects and the people who develop them, almost always for free, as well as those who learn privacy and security so they can help each other with it. Without that, only the best security experts could keep their data private.

And in a worst-case scenario, if *everything* goes wrong and they catch you doing something that really pisses them off, there's nothing like people you can trust around you, who will have your back and not snitch on you, and will remember you and visit you in jail if it comes to that.

The ultimate point of surveillance is fear, because without fear it's hard to control someone.

So let's take our control back, little by little.",58,0.99,3,1739063934,Anarchism

ButterscotchThick576,How Could an Anarchist Get Into Politics?,"Much of Anarchism as a social movement revolves around non-governmental mutual aid and other non-political support organizations. But if any given Anarchist sought to enter government with the intention to bring about at least some minor change how would they go about that?

At least for me, who does not like labels but would best be defined as an individualist anarchist — in which anarchism is a way of life that I personally hold myself to — I do not engage in the civic aspects of government, i.e. I do not vote because I believe it to be amoral. I am often critical of the possibility of actually effecting any real change through government, because it is the enemy after all. But I have considered after law school, I start next autumn, pursuing politics with the idea of at least keeping other politicians in check lol. But do not know how this would even work.

1. Would an Anarchist openly declare themselves as such, putting themselves at odds with the status quo and likely reducing the odds of being elected?

2. Would an Anarchist be better served by “playing the game” with an intent to reach higher offices in hopes of bringing about change more effectively?

3. Or would an Anarchist just best be served by staying out of politics and just focusing on what they can do personally to bring about social change?

LavaPlug4Bowser,Topic About DEIA,"If the ""good side"" wants ammunition, why not start spreading the word of DEIA rather than just DEI? This pdf was removed from the opm.gov website noted Jan 2025. State.gov had a pdf on DEIA that was removed Nov 2024. If these are such bad things why is the other side (the one in control not the people's side) making it obviously harder to find information about? 

So as we know that DEI is Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. Before recent times, most people never heard of it or did and forgot (myself included). What I was surprised to hear was that its actually been DEIA they've been going after which now stands for Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, AND Accessibility. It makes sense why the country founded on racism would want to make it seem like they're being racist cause thats what was ran on. So it makes sense that if you remove the word Accessibility from the equation, it makes it seem like its about race when in reality its been much more than that. [Didn't a certain fascist make common knowledge harder to obtain through the used-to-be available means at the time (i.e. newspapers, books, articles)? /rhetorical]

pean-,Anarchy news - print media to avoid the algorithm?,"I've had this thought; people HATE mainstream media nowadays. I'm talking liberals, fascists, hell it's somehow managed to piss the entire left off. Many people point to Fox, WSJ, NYT and other dominant news sources for their direct role in ""sanewashing"" fascists, presenting horrible, democracy-ending news as normal, and generally just being propaganda. 

See, the usual workaround to the liberal propaganda in recent years was independent journalism or just direct information on platforms like Twitter, TikTok, Instagram sorta and other online platforms, or relying on Google algorithms to promote their websites. The issue now is that those platforms have basically decided to censor everything that doesn't suck on fascist cock, so nobody is able to get their usual news from crowdsources or whatever. People are actually listening to local news and national news with fresh ears and finding it to be distasteful.

There is a demand in the general public for honest, truthful news about shit, and they aren't getting it online. They aren't getting it in their current newspapers either. Anarchists have done much work to get their message out but censorship and state repression of our ideas has blocked the reach of our ideas for many years. I propose a solution: 

Print media! 

Zines, posters, fliers, and even established papers such as Slingshot. Make them and spread them around! Hand them out to people while tabling on college campuses. Staple fliers to telephone poles. Throw out pointless bourgeois magazines from those ""free"" things and replace them with propaganda! 

I think the most important thing here is to remember to bring some proper journalism along with you. Write an essay about the actions going on in DC. Write about the truth of fascist deregulation causing deadly aviation accidents. Write protest reports! If you gain the public trust, you gain their ears.

Aggressive-Tale6363,am i a lost cause?,"edit: thanx for the encouragement&lt;3

hey everyone,

i’ve been ideologically anarchist for a decade. i haven’t engaged in much meaningful direct action, mostly just participated in a couple local protest movements alongside liberals

unfortunately i found my way to anarchism through reading and contemplation, not through a community. i had no concept of security at first, there was nobody to warn me that the state will not respect my freedom of thought and speech. so i’ve been posting about my politics on my personal social media accounts for years now

i only recently began taking the idea of privacy and security more seriously. my concern is that if i ever were to get involved in the anarchist community, i’d be a risk to everybody

it would be super easy for the police to connect my radical views to my legal name and to people i know. i’m a walking security hazard

so what if anything can i do to mitigate this hazard? does it actually work to delete my accounts, or will all that information still exist somewhere out there?

or should i resign myself to keeping my distance from any radical activity for life?",69,0.96,31,1738732074,Anarchism

Iggy6Jay,STRATEGIZE!,"As refreshing as it’s been to witness a conscientious surge, be mindful of how you let one another define class war. There’s been an abundance of those who are newly radicalized, ready to become revolutionaries. Rightfully so, outrage has the masses standing on business. Those who’ve been rooted should feel a responsibility to guide. Yes, there will be waves of people on the frontlines, but does it prove efficient that be your “station”? 

I don’t mean for the above to sound condescending.   Instead, a genuine plea that if you feel involved, please consider your stance. We’ve long fought the rise of this becoming; many groups formed in unison. Yet, they still inflate themselves with non-existing power, desecrating all voices unaligned, whether it be as a whisper or a gaggle. The organizing took place when your core values either aligned with or urged against this chauvinistic bullshit. Throughout the era’s, the fight has taken place. Strategizing is the only way we’ll overcome this.

It’s as though we’ve become so desensitized to headlines bold with “unprecedented” that we’re now ready to die for change. Don’t allow “martyr” to become hot press. Regardless of what radicalized you, do not effortlessly let radicalization become the end of you. That fight you felt is survival for all. How quickly we’ll be eradicated, charging forward prepared to die if needed. No, prepare to stand your ground at all costs. Those costs being any means to protect and persevere. Ironically, we are the heritage foundation. We are in need of protecting history, arts, architecture, science, theologies, and literature. Enforcing the removal of false narratives and the rhetoric whitewashing of it all. Return culture and protect those indigenous to the practices. Understand economics and political science but refuse contributions of that knowledge to the undeserving. Make an example of how infrastructure does not equate to industrialism nor capitalism. Prove that this is all possible while prioritizing humanity.
 
The ideal objective is to dismantle and discard crony capitalism, kleptocracy, patriarchs, oligarchs, fascism, elitism, misogyny, racism, police state - I mean fuck, for a crew to complain that LGTBQ was too long, they’ve sure pulled their fair share of the alphabet. To go against such will be tedious. An argument could be made from my “abolish all government” babes. Ashes too can be viewed as tiny little fragments remaining of a system now applied to the future as nothing more than a goddamn example. Just remember to go after the throats of the oppressors, not the oppressed, and be wise enough to know the difference. Still a complete cog in the system seeking fair justice and liberty for all with perhaps a sprinkle of order? You’ll need to be careful with the disassembling as you’re looking to reconstruct. All sides should remain open to the idea of direct democracy on some scale.

This thought became urgent to share when topics regarding 2/5 protests became large-scale. Some of the more linear thought processes I’ve witnessed debate whether it is a trap or not. The argument being that it doesn’t matter; solidarity is key. I completely agree that solidarity is key and should be the fundamental. You can protest in solidarity many ways. Before you stand in front of your capital, 
Buildings ask who is defenseless and vulnerable in the neighborhood over. Did we take advice on protecting ourselves from a surveillance state while accidentally whistleblowing an ally? Did we become irrational from fear? Yes, the masses need to be in the streets standing up for what’s right, but how many of us need to be in front of a building full of government officials that have done absolutely nothing aside from proving they can’t read your signs nor hear your words? To most of them, you’re fanatical. Take your march to the border, to neighborhoods of culture and diversity, to domestic violence shelters where they are already being attacked. Stay true to your pacifist nature if needed by supporting local communities. Read books to the children scared, bring groceries to the families hiding, be ready to stand for them while strengthening them. Embrace spatial awareness and you’d be shocked at the many ways you fight. I fear while we are so focused on what will come of Wednesday, they will be going after our most vulnerable.

Emergency_Okra_2466,Safety tips for protests,"With the tension rising in... pretty much anywhere, and having seen some threads in here about protests, I thought we could do a little thread about safety tips for protests. I'll start by contributing what I know and what I lived, and everyone can add stuff from their own experiences. Maybe we'll disagree on some points, but it's all for giving advices to people to make sure they stay safe. (Note: Also any advices here not encouraging anyone to talk about illegal stuff online, because those advices are about \*safety\* and talking about illegal stuff online definitely isn't safe.)

I'm not the guy with the most experience doing radical stuff during protest. But I'll still share what I have. It's mostly about ""What to do if you don't want to get arrested"", and mostly rely on being able to avoid getting stuck in complicated situations in the first place.

1:  
In 2012 (student strike in Québec), I was arrested not following a protest, but 3 months after it, because our local police had nothing else to do (Small rural city), and they wanted to file who were among the students of that specific protest in which we had blocked an exit from a public park after the prime minister came there. I wasn't even among the most radical people there at the time. I was just standing next to them, and cops happened to take my picture. It's part of what radicalized me, really. I had only stopped a guy from falling because he had been shoved by the police, and I myself tried to avoid contact with police as much as possible.

\&gt;So yeah, avoid getting close to the police because even if they don't touch you, even if you're not doing anything specifically illegal, they can find ways to arrest you if they want. Be aware of any officer further back who might be filming or taking pictures. If you spot them, (and don't want to be arrested), move away from the hot spots

2:

In 2015, I went to a protest in Montreal. It was taking place just after the anarchist bookfair, and was part of the wave of student protest against austerity measures. I was at the anarchist bookstore, and saw around 50 people marching so I just joined them. I had shirts in my bag, and ski goggles, just in case.  
They went to up to a street, I don't remember which, I don't know Montreal enough. It was a pedestrian street for the summer, but the cops suddenly drove in with minivans, just a bit faster than the retreating protesters were running. When the protesters where moving to the sides, the minivan stopped. Cops in riot gear got out of the minivans and grabbed the students that just got out of the vans' path. I had already moved to the sides as soon as the vans had showed up. There were not enough people to go and take them back.

\&gt; Don't stay in the streets if the protest can't hold it anymore (When you don't have the critical mass anymore). Move to the sides and keep your distance.  You can only hold a spot against the police if there are many, many more of you than there are of them, and you still need good protective equipment to do so, and it won't last forever.

3:

A bit later, during the same protest, I followed a group of Cégep students to the front of their college. Someone came and said that many of their friends were stuck in a kettle and they wanted to do something about it. I didn't want my picture taken again, so I used the shirts and ski google to become part of the black-bloc.

But while I was following the group, we came to an intersection. The street to the left was flanked by cops. So I stayed on the right side of the group. Seeing that all the people I was with were turning left between two rows of cops, I tried to say something, but quickly just left the protest and hid behind some brick pillar in front of a commerce entrance. When looking at the street, the cops had wheeled behind the small group I was with. They were now being kettled. I turned around the city block a while, found another protester that had been separated. We left the spot, and I had them check out while I was finding an isolated spot to remove my black shirts and goggles.

Under my t-shirt, I had a white, XVIIIth century style shirt and coat whose sleeves I had rolled up under the t-shirt. The person I was with told be: ""You don't look like a protester"". That was the point.

\&gt;Learn to recognize the signs of a kettle. Have disposable clothes if you want to conceal your identity. Avoid profiling by not looking like someone who would go to protests  (I know that last one is entirely dependant on privilege, but do your best)

4:

A few months earlier, we had taken part in a protest in winter in my rural homecity. I had a big red and black flag. I was masked, but my clothes were very noticeable. Me and my friend of the time did the protest, nothing illegal, but we still slowed traffic which is such a crime in the eyes of rural people... Coming back from the protest, we waited at our University. After a little while, we left, passed through a little wood to my appartment, but in the street of my appartment, we got stopped by police who questionned us, illegally asked us for our names and adress saying that IF we didn't comply we would be arrested. Of course they wanted our names so they would have files on the local protestors because we're a small city and there are not a lot of us out there.

\&gt;This is the counter-example to the last trick. A mask won't save you if your clothes are still recognizable and if you don't throw away your disguise in a spot that won't be seen. Also, scout ahead, even - or should I say - ESPECIALLY after the protest. Protests ends, but there are cops working around the clock and if they want to harass protestors, they can just wait for the protest to end and target people when they go back home, isolated and vulnerable.

5:  
In 2017, there were protests organized by racist group ""La Meute"" (wolf-pack) in Québec city. A bunch of reactionnary protesting against immigration. It was around the end of november, IIRC. There was a counter-protest organized by different leftwing organizations at the same time.  
I went there with a few friends from my small city, a 2 hour car ride away.

I was dressed with a good looking coat, something someone ""professional"" would wear. I walked here and there to try and scout things a bit. I went all the way up to the rightwing protest, and then came back down to our counter-protest. When I arrived, there was already a police line pushing on counter-protestors, many of which had white traces of maalox in their face to treat the pepper spray. I was behind the police line, they were on my right. I walked up to the foot of the Québec wall near the parliament.

I turned right in the little park that was empty and went back toward the parliament and the counter-protestors. A bit further back, a new police line was forming, flanking the more peaceful parts of the protest.  
I feigned innocence and asked the police to pass. They allowed me to do so.  
I went back into the protest and warned people that a kettle was forming up. Many more liberal counter-protestors told me that it wouldn't happen there.  
I found the people I came to Québec with, and told them it was time to leave.

The kettle was forming up. Near the parliament, there is a medieval-like wall in Québec, with a big door for the cars to pass through, and smaller doors on the sidewalks. A policeman with a dog was standing there. We were far enough from the rest of the protest that we didn't look like part of it.  
A policeman on the wall told another one that we could go through. The one with the dog said we couldn't. So I told him: ""Sorry sir, but your colleague on the wall told us to go. Can we know which one we must listen to first?"" He told us ""Okay you can go"".  
We went and reunited with other people of our region in a small cafe, waited an hour and then left Québec city.

We learned later that a few of our friends from Montreal, and one of our guy from our city, were arrested a bit further away, they were still forming a black bloc.

\&gt;Once again, if you don't have the critical mass, leave. If you see cops forming new lines on the sides of a protest, leave. Be able to become unnoticeable. Blend yourself in the crowd of ordinary people just walking by. People will say to stay in group.  
This is only good when standing your ground, and this can only be done if you're in numerical superiority.  
Sooner or later, the protest will scatter and cops will start targeting those smaller groups going home. Or the protest will just be kettled.

You need to know when it's starting to happen to be able to scatter and leave just before that. I'd even recommend people who decide to organize protests to adopt a ""guerilla"" style of protests: Do the protests with ordinary-looking people scouting ahead. At the first sign of cops, signal, scatter, and reconvene at another point.",49,0.98,3,1738623779,Anarchism

KelbyTheWriter,Why aren't you salting 2/5?,"All I’ve seen are statements about how this is a trap, but if people are showing up, shouldn’t we be as well? If we refuse, who fills the gap? What happens when the auth-comms show up instead? You can say it doesn’t matter, but history says otherwise. Occupy started as an anarchist movement and still got stolen. Why? Because anarchists were there first but didn’t hold the ground.

If anarchists aren’t showing up, who are we leaving this to? The same tankie organizers who will happily co-opt any movement that lacks a strong anti-state presence? The reformists who will pacify it into a series of symbolic gestures before declaring victory and going home? The state itself, which will push its own narrative in the absence of strong resistance?

I don’t buy the argument that this is some perfect “trap” that can only result in failure. Of course the state responds to uprisings with repression—that’s how it works. But if people are out in the streets, being radicalized by the violence of the system, that’s precisely where anarchists should be. If we’re not, then others will shape the narrative. We’ve seen it happen before.

So where is the strategy? Why aren’t we salting this?

Salting – when union organizers get jobs at non-union workplaces to organize from within. It works for labor, so why aren’t we doing it for protest movements? Instead of armchair commentary, why aren’t anarchists embedding themselves in these spaces to help push things further, keep them from getting co-opted, and actually make use of the energy that’s already there?

If I’m wrong, let’s talk about it. I don’t mind being challenged—I’m on edge, maybe not thinking clearly, but I don’t feel hazy. Just frustrated.

Thanks for your time.

MiroWiggin,Know your rights posters for the workplace? Coworker got taken by ICE.,"ICE recently showed up at my workplace asking about one of my coworkers. The floor manager said ""I'm not sure if he's here today, I'll go check"" to buy time then went and warned the coworker ICE was here for him, told him to hide and said he'd go tell the agents he wasn't there. But the coworker insisted on going to talk to them. I don't know why he thought talking to them was a good idea, likely thought it was a simple misunderstanding since he's here on a work visa, but our manager couldn't talk him out of it.

They dragged him out in handcuffs. 

This happened 8 days ago. His lawyer has been in contact with our general manager since then but we really have no information on his situation beyond which detention center they're holding him in.

This never should've fucking happened. I'm pretty sure they didn't even have a warrant so while I understand my floor manager was well-intentioned and was trying to cover for my coworker, he really should've just immediately told them to fuck off. 

I figured it'd be a good idea to put up some know your rights posters, specifically that are aimed at knowing your rights in the workplace and how to protect your coworkers when ICE shows up. Most of the KYR posters I've found online are focused on knowing your rights at home / on the street. Any links to good KYR posters are appreciated! I'm looking for English and Spanish versions. Also I might just make my own so recommendations on what info to include also helps! For context, I work at a restaurant in Massachusetts.

split1221,Witholding as a form of protest,"I was wondering what ways could really get back at the top 1%, whithout causing much harm to those involved. I think its easy to call for mass General strikes, but that takes a lot of planning and people would experience real harm by being out of work for what would likely need to be a multiple week strike. 

  
My proposal is this. Any left leaning person who has a mortgage should simply stop paying it. 

  
That's the elevator pitch, but more realistically the sudden loss of thousands of mortgage payments would cripple these banks. And its something that can be sustained for multiple months by the witholder. Month 1, you save $X amount of dollars. By month 2, they'll start making calls etc... Now you have $2x cash in your savings. MAYBE by month 3 they'll start making motions like they'll go to court. Maybe send a demand letter, it will be different in each state. But All in all, across each of the states, you'll likely have 3-6 months of being able to save up your mortgage payment, before they even get the courts involved. 

  
Now here we are at month 6, this has become a movement (1000 people per state could be enough, but obviously more is better), banks are really feeling the pain of not having the cash, and now you all are sitting on 6 months of mortgage that you can keep as cash, (or likely will use it to help with any varrying emergencies that will spring up in the next few months of the Regime). They start moving to foreclose on these homes. Depending on your state, you could be looking at an additional 6 months to upto and beyone 24 months. Especially since we'll now be clogging the already strained court system with all of these foreclosure cases. (Most firms handling foreclosure have lowered staffing levels since the 2008-2012 US mortgage crisis, it would likely take them 1-2 years to fire back up to 2010 levels to now match the demand to even file the cases). 

So, they blink. Then hey, no harm no foul, you've got the 6 months in the bank you can just bring everything current and we've had our demands met. If they don't, then as you can see, likely anyone who is fortunate to be in this situation would likely have 1-2 years to be able to weather this storm so it would likely be the Banks that crumble first. Only took about 2 weeks of witheld labor during the pandemic to realize that could make them cow.

MysticMind89,We need more Left-wing Propaganda,"This is something I've been mulling over since the 2024 US Election. For years, the far-right has been backed by massive think-tanks like Prager University and the Daily Wire, spewing propaganda and fear that has shaped the narratives of the political right, often putting trans people square in the crosshairs alongside ""Illegals"" as an easy outgroup to represent the ""degeneration"" of society.

  
The Right has formed a cult of personality around Trump, swallowing wholesale the red scare propaganda over the ""Communist"" Democrats, all while the Democrats gleefully skip behind them, trying to imitate them and pleasing absolutely no one. I only advocate for participating in Capitalist Democracy to keep the worst reactionaries out of power, as it's foolish to think the Democrats will stand up for anyone but the Capitalist class.



But as we've seen, when the Democrats fail to commit to standing up for human rights, giving wishy-washy none-answers like ""I'll follow the law"", people stay home. And when people stay home, the MAGA cult flocks out in droves to make their [idolatrine](https://genius.com/Ghost-idolatrine-lyrics) the law of the land, further erasing human rights and enforcing Christian Nationalist brand Fascism.

  
This brings me to my point about Anarchism. The simple truth of the matter is that we need more propaganda, more art, more literature, to drag this world kicking and screaming toward a better future. Already, mega entertainment corps like Disney are erasing overt trans representation in media to please their bigoted shareholders, walking back on the bare minimum token representation they already had.

  
We cannot let the far-right [control the conversation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CaPgDQkmqqM) any more than they already have. We've seen what happens when our so-called leaders refuse to offer any sufficient counter to these narratives, stuck in an endless loop of [we go low, you go high.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAbab8aP4_A) We are watching in real time as the right uses culture war narratives to justify human rights atrocities, and since the Democrats are too preocupied with ""Playing by the rules"" (no matter how much the other side stacks the deck), we need to cut through the bullshit with our own propaganda, in conjunction with direct community-based action, to protect the lives of LGBTQ+ people and other targeted minorities.

  
Every piece of art we make helps to further cement our place in culture, even when the state tries to censor us. Society is nothing without the individual actions of people collectively working to protect the persecuted. So even if all you can do is pick up a pencil or type in a word document, we need you to do it, and we need to bolster those who do just as much as those directly acting to protect the most vulnerable amongst us.

  
Ticking a box once every four years won't save us. It's not useless, but it's just one small part of a much grander effort to fight back against the far-right's culture war.

The locals have been pushing back against these intrusions for years. The film follows Setsuko Yamazato, who's been at the forefront, defending her community's culture and environment.

For context, here is a video showing her protest and fight against the imposed opening of a military base in Ishigaki.

Our work will focus on archiving her knowledge, both empirical and spiritual, and her deep link with the island, dating from her time running around the jungle in the refugee camp where she was displaced as a child.

Here is the work-in-progress trailer. (for the crowdfunding)

And what I'm really wishing would happen, instead of AFM, is a neighborhood assembly where we can meet each other and talk about what to do if we see ICE.

The thing is... I just moved to this neighborhood a month ago. I don't know many people. I haven't even hung out with the other three people in my building yet (though I have their numbers). That's why I'm not just like ""I'm gonna go talk to X Y and Z and we'll start organizing the assembly!""

I'm just gonna start talking to people about the idea. Cuz.. so far no one else is doing it, and it clearly needs to get done. You don't have to be an anarchist to realize that.

My plan is to try to find nexus points in the neighborhood -- people who are connected to a lot of other people. Like bartenders is my first thought. Cafe and restaurant workers. Salon workers. I'm White, so I should probably prioritize anywhere with PoC workers.

I think it'll be a pretty easy sell. People are really scared, and the best way to deal with fear, I think, is to prepare (and get people to know each other!!). People *want* something like this, even if they don't know it yet.

Once I get a few key people on board, I think it could pick up steam really quickly.

lovelylittleanon,Is it cowardly to leave America right now?,"I am a disabled, trans, and queer adult living in the US right now. My parents recently brought up us leaving due to the recent election. Part of me agrees because we don’t want to be those people who get stuck in a dying country, but the rest of me feels it’s wrong, that we should stay here and fight for our rights and against the oppression of the government we’re seeing right now.

But, I cannot physically go to protests or sit ins. My health is deteriorating, and because of the way insurance is here, I can’t get it right now so I’m just not alright, basically. I’ve done everything I can think of (signing petitions, sharing information, sending letters, etc.) that doesn’t put my health at risk. Beyond that, fucking hell, rights are being taken away left and right.

Is it cowardly to consider leaving? To leave for the sake of keeping myself and my family safe, and abandon everyone here to the wolves?

Edit because I realized this wasn’t specified: This is 3/4ths pipe dream. We aren’t very privileged people, we aren’t rich, but the thought of this makes me feel wrong even if it never comes to fruition or turns out impossible.

It happened in the UK but I'm also wondering if it happened in the US. The rise of the internet was happening around that time too so while many people may be blaming the internet and while the internet may be of contributing factor I'm wondering how much things like 9/11 and the 2008 financial crisis also played a part and I took a look at the trustworthiness level the American people trusted the government over a period of time and I saw that there was a rise around around 9/11 and then it just went down and it seemed like it never really recovered.

And as you probably know things like recessions and financial instability create an opportunity for the rides in the far right.

I'm just interested in your thoughts on this as well as wondering why people started distrusting around 9:11 because I thought that people would have been really excited about that because it was such gung-ho patriotism and nationalism and I thought people would have been very trusting of the government at the time but it seems like it almost immediately went down after the attack rather than going up first and then going down which is what I would have expected more.",52,0.9,38,1738510545,Anarchism

EndColonization,"""Practicing what you preach"" and working in government systems","I’ve been thinking about the idea of anarchists working within government systems. Some argue that this is a way to “practice what they preach,” but I see a contradiction that’s worth addressing.

Anarchy, at its core, is about rejecting hierarchical control, state authority, and the structures that uphold oppression. Governments exist to maintain power over people, and their systems are designed to sustain themselves, not to be dismantled from within. So when someone claims to be an anarchist while actively working in government, it raises an important question: **Are they truly practicing anarchist ideals, or are they just participating in the very system they claim to oppose?**

Now, I understand that survival under capitalism requires compromise. Many of us take jobs within systems we don’t fully align with because we need to pay bills, get healthcare, or navigate the reality we were born into. There’s no shame in that. But let’s be honest, there’s a difference between working a job to survive and working for the government while claiming to resist it.

If your paycheck comes from an institution built on oppression, you’re **reinforcing** that institution’s existence, whether intentionally or not. You can believe you’re making a difference, but real systemic change doesn’t come from within systems designed to preserve themselves. Governments don’t allow people to hold real power unless it serves their function. That’s why historically, even well-intended reformists end up constrained by the structures they work within.

With the growing threats we’re facing, environmental collapse, increased surveillance, rising authoritarianism, we don’t need more people trying to “fix” a system that was never meant to serve us. We need more people turning their backs on it entirely. Saying no more to oppressive laws, exploitative labor, and a system that actively works against us. We spend so much of our time, energy, and resources feeding a machine that is trying to kill us. Imagine what could happen if that energy was redirected into something better.

I’m not telling people what to do, everyone has to make their own choices. But personally, I believe the future isn’t in reforming or working within the system. It’s in walking away from it. In creating something new, something prosperous, something that actually serves us. A world where we invest in each other, not in a dying system that was built to control us.

We all exist within oppressive systems, but how we engage with them matters. The question isn’t just **what we do**, but ***why***, and whether our choices are truly moving us toward liberation, or just making it easier to exist within the system as it is.",1,1,9,1738497101,Anarchism

When I say the word ""socialism"" in South Korea, most of my compatriots think of Aoji Coal Mine in North Korea, Gulag, or Tiananmen Square. Such fear and bias are often affiliated with anti-Chinese, anti-Taiwanese and anti-Singaporean racism (because China is a Dengist ""communist"" country), thus fueling far-right politics in my motherland.

Content_Ad2226,A dream from an elder and her mother,"I had a dream last week. I was a child, and in the center of my childhood bedroom there was a rattlesnake coiled up and waiting. I called for mom. Someone came but it wasn't my mom. My real mom had killed rattlesnakes when I was a kid to protect us. One time, she sliced one into pieces with the blade of a shovel.But this imposter mom was worried about the snake's health. It used a roll of paper towels to gather the snake up. ""No,"" I complained, ""it'll bite you through the towel, what are you doing?! Why?!"" But she didn't listen. This was not my mom.  
  
She took it out the front door and released the snake not ten feet from the door in some misguided catch-and-release nonsense. The snake rushed toward me and I woke up screaming.My therapist thinks the 'mom' in this dream was my perception of the DNC and oppositional establishment in the US. I agree. I am a politically disenfranchised person and only have one vote. I rely on broader civil society to protect me from discrimination and harm. They seem to have failed me, lately.My real mom just spoke to me today. She shared a dream she had on Wednesday. She dreamed of a giant Trump head in a MAGA hat attached to the body of a giant snake looming over her in darkness. At her side was a female family member, maybe me, maybe her sister, or my sister. My mom shouted ""GRAB A POLE!"" and together, she and the other woman started bashing the snake.  
  
My mom said she saw the face's cheeks puff up and distort and then she realized that's where she had to strike. She smashed through it with the pole, describing it to me on the phone as 'that grisly resistance feeling you get when you cut through an animal' (I love my mother). Then the snake dissolved.  
  
We then talked about meaningful action, and how the destruction of this evil has to come not from our American left, but the world, because if it comes from only us, they will continue to denounce and deflect and lie and claim conspiracy.  
  
This is a global threat. And I love my mom. And I know she, a woman of influence and consequence, is connected with men, women, laborers, and policy makers here in Washington who all despise this administration and are committed to real action.

DemonicsGamingDomain,Anarchism Propaganda - Rule-Breaking,"I think this technically fits here, this is a small portion on the complex field hyper-sanity that pertains to the ideals of anarchism.

If it doesn't fit please lemme know why as I'm still learning about anarchism in comparison.  
I did this last year when I had more time to learn/research.

Think of hyper-sanity as a framework for perspectives, using consequential mechanics for outcomes, this isn't about inherent ethical frameworks - there's many ways it can be applied in practice, just like critical-thinking isn't inherently good/bad, depends on how it's used.



If rules were never broken there'd never be growth or evolution, the secret in life that no-one will tell you is - which ones to break; and when.

In a world where conformity often feels like the safest path, rule-breaking is frequently viewed with suspicion. However, through the lens of hypersanity, rule-breaking emerges not as a reckless endeavor but as an essential catalyst for growth and transformation, both on a personal and societal level. This perspective asks us to rethink not just the necessity of rules but the very nature of why they exist and how they shape our experiences.

The reality is that not all rules are designed to nurture or protect. Many are relics of past circumstances, established in times that required stability or control. They may have been created by individuals who sought to maintain power or simply to preserve a tradition without questioning its present-day utility. Growth, then, requires the discernment to differentiate between those rules that foster development and those that impede progress. It calls for the courage to break those rules that have outlived their relevance and now serve as barriers rather than bridges.

Rule-breaking, therefore, becomes an act of liberation. It is a means of freeing ourselves from outdated paradigms that hinder progress, enabling us to step into new realities where personal and collective growth can thrive. The journey of questioning, challenging, and ultimately breaking certain rules is what allows society to evolve. This evolution is not about discarding all structures but about understanding which structures still serve us and which ones need transformation. Rule-breaking, when approached with wisdom and responsibility, is an exercise in conscious evolution—an act that honors the potential for positive change.

**Intelligent Rule-Breaking: Courage and Discernment**

Hypersanity involves a deeper insight—a profound awareness that surpasses conventional definitions of sanity. In this state, one discerns which rules require breaking for growth. It is not about rebellion for rebellion's sake; it is about intentional action, driven by clarity and guided by a responsibility towards both oneself and society. Intelligent rule-breaking is thus an act of courage that comes with understanding the deeper purposes these rules serve or fail to serve.

Consider **scientific paradigms**: throughout history, some of the most groundbreaking scientific advancements have come from breaking away from established norms. Newton's laws once provided a comprehensive view of the physical world, but Einstein dared to question and expand upon them, ultimately reframing our understanding of physics. This type of rule-breaking wasn't rooted in a desire to dismantle the old, but rather to grow beyond its limitations, to find deeper truths that served humanity's evolving understanding of the universe.

Einstein’s work is a perfect example of how rule-breaking, when approached intelligently, leads to expansion. It required not only technical knowledge but also a deep awareness of where the existing framework fell short. Breaking away from Newtonian physics was not an act of destruction but one of creation—ushering in new possibilities for how we perceive time, space, and gravity. It demonstrates that the true essence of intelligent rule-breaking lies in understanding where the old models limit us and how new models can bring a more accurate and complete understanding of reality.

Similarly, **social norms and justice** have seen profound shifts because individuals or movements challenged entrenched beliefs. The progress in civil rights, gender equality, and environmental protection has often come from a willingness to disregard the outdated norms that perpetuated injustice. It was not reckless rebellion but an intentional choice rooted in empathy and a vision for a more inclusive society. The courage to break these social ""rules"" is what drives meaningful transformation—it paves the way for a better collective reality.

Movements such as the Civil Rights Movement or the suffragette movement did not succeed simply because people were willing to break rules—they succeeded because the individuals involved understood the broader implications of the norms they challenged. They recognized that these outdated rules served only to marginalize and divide. This kind of rule-breaking required a willingness to endure social disapproval, to risk personal safety, and to maintain a steadfast vision of a more just world. It required hypersanity—a profound awareness that transcended the superficial sense of order, driven by a deeper understanding of what true justice and equality demanded.

On a **personal level**, growth involves breaking the ""rules"" within ourselves—rules shaped by our upbringing, past experiences, or society's influence. Many of these rules are internal boundaries that once served a protective role but now limit us. Hypersanity involves recognizing which of these rules are necessary boundaries, essential for well-being, and which are outdated beliefs that hinder personal evolution. Growth, in this sense, means dismantling those limiting beliefs with insight and replacing them with more expansive perspectives.

We are often taught rules about what is possible for us—rules about our capabilities, our worth, and our potential. Many of these rules become internalized as limiting beliefs, and they restrict our ability to grow and explore new possibilities. Breaking these rules requires deep introspection, a willingness to face discomfort, and the courage to challenge our self-imposed limitations. It means seeing beyond the restrictions imposed by fear, past failures, or societal expectations, and embracing a version of ourselves that is continuously evolving. Hypersanity guides us to see that true personal growth involves not just self-improvement but the dismantling of internal constructs that keep us confined to a limited version of who we are.

**The Wisdom to Break Selectively**

Through the hypersane lens, true wisdom lies in the ability to selectively break the rules that no longer serve us. It is a balanced approach that requires knowledge, foresight, and accountability. Rule-breaking, when done wisely, is not merely about the thrill of defiance; it is about transformation—it is about understanding the intricate dance between what should be preserved and what must be dismantled to make way for something greater.

This selective practice demands both courage and awareness. It is a journey of acting in alignment with one's values, even when those actions defy the expectations or norms that surround us. Hypersanity provides the vision to see beyond the status quo, to understand the dynamics of power, control, and potential, and to act in ways that honor growth, connection, and truth.

The key is discernment—knowing when breaking a rule will serve the greater good and when it may cause unnecessary harm. It is about acting from a place of awareness rather than ego. When we break rules in a hypersane manner, we are not motivated by the desire to prove ourselves right or superior. Instead, we are motivated by a deeper understanding of what needs to change for growth to occur. It is about bringing more authenticity, freedom, and depth to our lives and to the systems we are part of.

By cultivating the courage to break the rules that hold us back, we allow ourselves to engage in a dynamic and meaningful process of growth. This type of rule-breaking is inherently creative—it involves not just rejecting old limitations but envisioning and building something better in their place. Through hypersanity, we gain the insight to know which boundaries are meant to be respected and which are meant to be transcended, leading us toward a life that is more expansive, liberated, and aligned with our highest values.

Ultimately, rule-breaking through the hypersane perspective is about honoring the potential for growth in all its forms. It is about trusting in our ability to discern wisely, to challenge courageously, and to evolve continuously. It reminds us that true progress—whether personal, scientific, or societal—depends on our willingness to question the old and dare to create the new.",7,0.73,1,1738368989,Anarchism

Ok-Instruction-3653,On The Topic Of Censorship And Criticism of The Left.,"For starters, I don't consider myself a leftist, I consider myself a revolutionary/radical. The topic of censorship, expands beyond my criticism of the left, because censirship can happen with individual people, groups,anfd just overall it can be a societal problem. 

I'm no stranger to censorship, and critizing online spaces. The reason why censorship is problematic is because it doesn't allow for open discussion conversation and valid criticism of particular rhetoric/ideologies, people/groups/societies can be so sensitive as not to allow such criticism of their beliefs and ideologies. I've encounterred censorship many times simply for giving honest opinions, or critique of certain views, and reddit as a platform is well known for its censorship habits, it can be irritating. 

Censorship for me is unappealing because it sends the message that people/groups/societieds are closed-minded, and  lack critical thinking. Censorship severely limits growth and critical thinking, and expansion on philosopical thinking. 

Anyways, I feel as though the left is pretty authoritarian, it's filled with authoritarian leftist that believe that ""State Socialism"" and ""State Communism"" is possible, when In the past revolutions with Russia and the soviet union/USSR, and China with the CCP have failed, because these system reproduced State Capitalism. Simply by referring to these countries as Socialist or Communist isn't accurate to what Socialistm and Communism is defined as. 

Socialism is classified as workers having free association and ownership over the means of production and the abolition of the Capitalist class and their monopolization of the means of production and workers control.

Communism is defined as a Moneyless, Stateless and Classless society, none of which the USSR and the CCP have achieved, therefore they aren't Socialist or Communist, for many authoritarian leftist they have a visceral reaction to this criticism, which led to me being banned from the Sociallist reddit forum. Which is precisely why I criticize the left, and don't consider myself a leftist because of their authoritarian views with Statism, Socialism and Communism.


We can never move forward and make progress if we can't have opened minded discussion or people not being to sensitive with their ideology/rhetoric. Censorship prevents this, and it precisely how it's supposed to function by suppressing free speech and having certain biases to the more conformist or favorable ideologies/rhetoric. 

I believe it's an oxymoron, to say that a country can be Socialist or Communist, and operate in a Socialist and Communist ways. Countries serve the purpose of Nationalism, Statism, Imperialism, and Colonialism.





Edit: I made this post to critque the Authoritarian left and biased censorship, so if you're not an Authoritarian leftist this post isn't for you, and if you're not a biased moderator that censores people because they have different political opinions then these criticism are definitely not for you.

I made this post based on my observations of Leftist spaces, not every reddit is the same, however im particular to Revolutionary/Radical spaces, when it comes to expressong opinions, I believe it's okay to disagree without censorship, (that's what downvotes are for).

This post may seem controversial to some and maybe taboo and that's completely fine. But I'm mostly critiqing the Authoritarian left and biased moderators of Revolutionary/Radical subreddits.

We stand at a crossroads in history. The fascist candle burns brighter than ever, offering a false hope to a desperate working class.

Blinded by despair, the proletariat clings to its dim glow, believing it leads to prosperity. But this candle does not guide—it consumes. It feeds on the very people it claims to illuminate.

The promises of social mobility, wealth, and fairness crumble under the reality of an ascendant technocratic bourgeoisie, whose privilege is no longer even hidden.

Meanwhile, the “fake” left—the corporate-backed liberals, the hollowed-out European social democrats—have abandoned the working class, leaving them vulnerable to the so-called “patriots” who wave their wallets as flags.

It’s time to reignite a real flame—not of empty promises, but of unity, strength, and class solidarity.

Odd-Quality-11,Never ever turn off your phone: rethinking security culture in the era of big data analysis.,"TLDR:

1. Never turn off your phone – A sudden absence of metadata (like turning off your phone) can be more suspicious than maintaining normal activity.


2. Stick to your usual patterns – If you're doing something sensitive, make sure your metadata (like app usage, location, and routines) looks the same as any other day.


3. Be aware of your networks – Your connections (social media, WiFi, shared files, etc.) can be used to map your affiliations, so limit unnecessary digital ties.


4. Keep adapting – As surveillance technology evolves (e.g., facial recognition, license plate tracking), security strategies need to change too—stay informed and flexible.

newnewengland,Anarchists in Municipal Government,"Hey there, for a long time, I've held views that align with the anarchist spirit of challenging power structures and removing them wherever possible. At the same time, I've often thought about what the ideal, utopian society would like. Or at least, what a society transitioning to that could look like. I've been paralyzed, because I've seen no path for me, other than as a naysayer, a complainer, a whiner, a critic.

I've read a bit, and done some thinking on my own, and I've basically arrived at the conclusion that human beings are essentially organized into hierarchies and systems that are extremely messed up, with state power (at the national level) being the common enemy hanging over all our heads (as I think anyone on this sub might agree). 

I don't believe it's possible to attack the nation-states from the top-down and be ""stateless"" at any point in my my life. And I don't believe in an every-man-for-himself way of life either. I believe that full human potential is unlocked when we work in harmony with the Earth and with each other. Thus, some level of cooperation is necessary.

I've been inspired by reading Bookchin, and by reading about ""sewer socialism"" and now believe that cities and towns may be a good place to start making serious changes to get people more engaged in democracy, in managing the little piece of Earth that we share, in figuring out how to share our limited resources, and so on.

I am considering running for local office and want to bring along a vision for radical change based on some of Bookchin's ideas. I want to make democracy more inclusive. I want to emphasize quality of life over more standard economic indicators that the businessmen who usually sit in my local government champion.  I want our city to put the environment more at the forefront of every choice we make. I want to stop spending so much on police (I believe it should be everyone's long-term goal to abolish police or radically redefine what policing is; who wants to imagine a world where crime will always need to be fought by bullies with guns?)

What do folks think of this vision? What are some ideas you have about how to take notions of ""fighting the power"" into local government?",3,1,2,1738097605,Anarchism
[deleted],LinkedIn Protest and Action,"Please consider participating in a political protest on LinkedIn.  LinkedIn hosts an international mixed audience with influence and money.  Corporate, government, and religious bodies are exposed.  A considerable fraction of its users are sympathetic.  Over the past few days I did a test run and had some success.  I did not see much concurrent resistance activity but there is quite a bit of existing political discussion.

I began with my authentic LinkedIn profile.  I have worked as a US engineer for a few companies and had around 500 contacts.  I do not think LinkedIn is particularly useful for career purposes and have not been very active.

I believe my most successful tactic was targeting company posts.  As an example, many companies with millions of followers made posts “celebrating” MLK Jr. day.  On these I commented “Company Name CEO Name, what is your opinion on Musk’s Nazi salute?”  I then liked the company post and reposted it to my account with the same comment as a description.

I also commented on a few corporate disclosures.  As an example, a Germany company posted a video where the CEO talked about political changes improving business prospects.  I wrote something about these policies being similar to those of the AfD and asked whether he supported Elon Musk’s salute.  I happened to be the first commenter and believe many people saw this.  Individuals with inside and industry knowledge could gather considerable attention in this way.

I interacted with both conservative and progressive commenters.  Many of my statements were upvoted or argued.  I am not sure how effective this was but it is somewhat visible.

I posted a few news articles.  I am not sure how effective this is because it was hard to get impressions.

A few people complained that my behavior was not work appropriate but I think most users are in favor of free speech.

Over about three days I accumulated about 300 profile views and 4000 impressions.  Some very influential people with job titles like VP and Chief Communications Officer viewed my profile.  People from all over the world viewed my profile.  A royal liked one of my comments.  Women seemed particularly sympathetic and courageous.  This was a test run and I am not particularly well versed in social media.

It is possible to directly post articles, videos, and Reddit content.  I think it is possible to generate fake accounts with nothing more than an email.  Someone named Elon Musk with a picture of Elon Musk liked a comment.

This morning I woke up to find that my account had been suspended.  It took them 3 days to do this and I suspect they can be overwhelmed.  The email indicates that this is due to potential identity theft.  I was asked to provide images of government identification to restore access.  I do not know if my account will be restored.

I also received one warning for hate speech.  This warning threatened potential account suspension.  I had written “Fuck Trump.”  I do not think this is hate speech.  This comment was up for something like 1.5 days before I received the warning.  Using language like fascist and Nazi may or may not be recommended but I was very aggressive.

I understand many people are hesitant to participate due to exposure at their job.  It was very difficult to get upvotes from my network.  I am not sure how many of my previous contacts were online but only one person had the courage to like an article that I posted.

Thank you for taking the time to read this.  If you like this idea please help distribute it across Reddit and anywhere else.  I have been a Reddit lurker for about 3 years but have limited karma and am unable to make my own standalone post.",29,0.91,18,1738086350,Anarchism

Ok-Instruction-3653,There's a Shift,"I keep an eye on this forum. However I see flaws in Revolutionary and Radical thought here. 

Most revolutionaries still have this ideal of a revolution being about Anarchist, Anticapitalist, Antiauthoritarians, overthrowing the system of State and Capitalism overnight through vanguard militarized action. When this is not only a power fantasy but it wouldn't be useful or effective on actually changing our material reality. It would only reproduced a Capitalist and Statist system.

A revolution is a series of uprisings, resistances and revolts against current political system that exist which don't work or serve in favor of the masses. While we can't plan an Anarchist society, because it would be a finality, a revolution does take strong horizontal power structures and planning  and proper self-defense against Fascism and Statism. 

I feel as though it's easy to talk about revolution online and discuss theory, but it's takes more energy and effort to put in the praxis. For many people whether you're a radical or not, we often love the idea of community but lack motivation, energy or time commitment to craft the society we want to build, mostly due to a hyper individuallist society we already live under, we tend to pay attention more to our personal issues, which is valid. And revolutionary action isn't going to look the same for everyone, internationally we all deal with different varying degrees of oppression that need different solutions. When it comes to praxis there isn't a formula that fits everyone.


It's easy to be lazy in thinking and praxis about revolution especially for those that are already dealing with hyper individuallism and isolation. Which is my case as well. It's especially more of a challenge when there's a task of educating people on Anarchist views, the bedrock of revolution is people recognizeing their dialectic material conditions, learning about the oppressive institutions they must eradicate, and educating other people in the processes, forming mutal networks etc. However class consciousness, comes from societies having to experience the destructive natures of a system.

In the case of the American Empire it is in major decline and has been for decades, economic crisis, environmental crisis with climate change and illnesses, inflation, etc. it's an Empire that's in denial, and it's the working class that will suffer from the decline, not the Demagogues or the Capitalist. The problem is that many people still buy into the Electoral system every four years hoping for change because that's much easier than the effort of direct action for some. 

Anyway a bit of a rant, but I just find it weird and irritating how many people still have this belief that a revolution will happen overnight through militarized vanguard action when it's more complicated than that, and revolutionnary action isn't the same for all of us across the globe. I also find it extremely weird how some people believe the State will ""help"" in the  Anticapitalist and Antistatist revolution. History has shown that when there's any opposition that is a threat to the State that it will eliminate its opposition through force and coercion. ",234,0.97,28,1737951726,Anarchism
Advanced-Hat2338,We Are More Than Cogs; We Are the Revolution,"For too long, we’ve been fed a lie. A lie that we’re free, that this system works for us, that if we just work hard enough, we’ll achieve the dream. But look closer—the dream is a mirage, designed to keep us chasing while they reap the rewards. The few, those at the top, have declared themselves gods, ruling over us as though they own not just the wealth but the very air we breathe.

The truth is harsh, but it must be said: we are nothing more than cogs in their machine, spinning endlessly to make the rich richer, the powerful more powerful. But if we can’t live free, the system can’t stand.

We’ve been told that scarcity is the reason for our struggle. That there aren’t enough resources, so we must compete, fight, and claw for scraps. But that’s another lie. Think about this: there are over 333 million people in America alone—and the reality is, we have the resources to stop the constant churn of mass production, to live sustainably, and still thrive. There’s enough land, food, energy, and technology to create a society that ensures every single person’s survival and dignity.

So why don’t we? Because this system thrives on greed. Corporations would rather let food rot in warehouses than give it to the hungry. They’d rather pollute rivers and destroy forests than lose a dollar of profit. They’d rather exploit our personal data, manipulate us with marketing, and push endless consumerism than admit the truth: this isn’t about meeting our needs; it’s about feeding their power.

They sell us the illusion of choice while using psychological manipulation to control our desires. They’ve turned our lives into commodities, our data into currency, and our labor into fuel for their machine. The system wasn’t built to serve us—it was built to enslave us. But our unity, their downfall.

History shows us the truth. From the Gilded Age of robber barons to the billionaires of today, the system has always been rigged. Corporations crush workers to cut costs. Politicians sell their souls to the highest bidder. Wars are waged to protect profits, not people. Many voices, one movement is their greatest fear.

But here’s the thing—they only win if we stay divided. They’ve spent decades pitting us against each other. Left vs. right. Rural vs. urban. Black vs. white. It’s a strategy straight out of Orwell’s 1984. They want us too distracted fighting one another to see the real enemy. Because they know the truth: we are more than cogs in their machine; we are the revolution.

Think about the power we hold. Together, we outnumber them a thousand to one. Together, we are unstoppable. They control the wealth, the media, and the laws, but none of that matters if we refuse to comply. If we unite, resist, and rebuild, we can create a system that works for all of us, not just the privileged few. The time is now: unite, resist, rebuild.

This isn’t just about tearing down their machine. It’s about building something better. A future where no one is exploited for a paycheck, where no child goes hungry, where no voice is silenced because it challenges the status quo. It’s about reclaiming the dream they’ve stolen from us. Rise as one, reclaim the future.

We are done begging for scraps from their table. We’re done watching as they strip our communities of opportunity while lining their pockets. We’re done believing the lie that this is just the way things are. No gods, no masters—only freedom.

They want you to feel small. Powerless. But remember this: their power comes from us. Every hour we work. Every dollar we spend. Every time we stay silent. Fight the few, empower the many. If we withdraw that power, their system crumbles.

We stand at a crossroads. On one side is the broken system they want us to accept. On the other is a future we can build together. A future where we’re no longer cogs in their machine but the architects of our destiny. The choice is clear: their system, our power, one reckoning.

I’ll leave you with the words of Thomas Jefferson: ""When injustice becomes law, resistance becomes duty.""

Let this be our duty. Let this be our spark. Let this be the moment we reclaim what is ours.

i feel more and more that we might need to take greater control of the narrative and shape our messages to resonate with and radicalise the normies in a decentralized populist movement kinda way 

where other people slightly to the right of us (either a bit more authoritarian or capitalist or whatever it may be) are in an environment online that we actively attempted to make hostile to anything vaguely right wing ideas, the same way they did it to us, when they were portraying us and our ideas as irrational or going too far or unreasonable. 

basically flipping it on them with our own ""grifters"" or public figures and yappers and comments section takeovers where we make sure everything is centered on what WE wanna talk about 

I feel like we have a better leg to stand on because leftist ideas have almost always directly improved people's quality of life when implemented even slightly. fairness, kindness, empowerment, cooperation, self expression, connection, saving nature and having a thriving ecosystem. all these things are pretty easy to sell I think. so if we tried as hard as they did to market ourselves it'd be a clean sweep.

thewanderingseeker,"I am an anarchist, and have really always been one","This is mostly a rant about my process of self discovery leading to anarchism. If you don’t feel like reading a redditor’s summarized ideological life story feel free to move on to another post. But thank you if you decide to stay. 

I am very happy to call myself an anarchist after several years of floating in the political limbo of not adhering strictly to an ideology. I grew up protestant in the US and from there I naturally became a good ol’ american neoliberal, as I would have called myself a christian conservative when i was an older teenager. That didn’t last too long as I only adhered to that ideology from growing up in that environment, but deep down I knew that wasn’t really who I am even if i didn’t realize that at first. 

A few existential crises later I was floating around in an ideological void after leaving american christianity behind, hanging out with my two new best friends who happen to be a tankie and an anarchist. How they are such close friends being so ideologically opposed in many ways is another interesting story entirely on its own. I began to realize i’ve always had a pretty left leaning personality and values, but now i’d fully get the chance to express them in their totality. But I had a choice to make. I was surrounded by auth communism along with anarchism at the same time, and I couldn’t choose. I had convinced myself that “anarchy wouldn’t work” and that the auth commies had to be right. “Who would run air traffic control in an anarchist commune?” I thought. So I called myself a Marxist for a little while. It didn’t stick. I kinda hated it actually. My body rebelled against the label. 

Another year or so went by. And the answer ended up being a lot more simple than I ever would have thought: What do I want to live out as my own life and help welcome the world into? And that answer is anarchism. I don’t like state power structures. I don’t like vertical hierarchy. I hate oppression. There’s hardly a worse feeling than the weight of authority upon one’s being. I want every human being to have no one above them, no one below them. None be forced to bear the weight of nations. None be beaten down by the force of the state. 

Other answers followed from there. What’s stopping us from running air traffic control? We don’t have to have a hierarchy to do it. All it takes is action and coordination.

A lot of ideas I had for a very long time have begun to click one after the other. Even when I was immersed in american protestantism I always disliked the power structures in church and school and wondered why we couldn’t do things differently and actually be fair to each other and help each other. Like how some kids went without lunch cause they couldn’t pay for it. I’ve always thought money to be such a stupid concept. 

So anarchism for me was a bit inevitable really. Wanting to dismantle hierarchy has always been in me. I hope I can find a place here on this subreddit and others like this one. If you’ll have me, as a young anarchist, let’s dismantle the structured world. ",78,0.95,13,1737887147,Anarchism

Growing up I used to like this country.

But knowing all the crimes australia has committed I just feel sort of lost.

I don't want to be a colonizer, I don't want to be in this system and I feel shame for being a white person living here.

I feel hopeless in my situation especially struggling financially and always worried I am gonna get hatecrimed for being queer. I wish I wasn't living in a colony but it's not like I can just leave.

I want to do the right thing but a. I barely have the energy to take care of myself. b. I don't know what I should be doing anyway.

I feel like an outsider in the place I was born and I don't know what to do about it.

What's something that I can do that is within my means?

Jeeze I'm sorry if this is a bit of a ramble

TLDR: How can I call some place home when it shouldn't be my home in the first place and was stolen from someone else.

Update: I'm sorry if I caused any arguments, I have a tendency to internalize things more than I should.

It's no Luigi level but hey its not a competition as well.

Do not be mistaken , the cops were absolutely violent whenever they could and now the mud wizzard is facing charges for assault. Another level of violence.

I will comment the video in the comments because it's just plain and simple jouissive to see riot Police being absolutely patheticly neutered by  mud.

OK, I've written many [articles](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/1hr4vn1/south_korean_yoon_seokyeol_regime_has_tried_to/) [about the](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/1htaq00/reasons_for_lack_of_libertarian_socialism_in/) [current South](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/1i11moh/south_korean_news_white_skeleton_corps_appears_to/) [Korean crisis](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/1i77pqy/south_korea_supporters_of_president_yoon_break/). However, I didn't mention the crucial point of this unrest: the election fraud conspiracy theory, the result of right-wing populism and authoritarianism in our society. And that's why I'm explaining about South Korean right-wing populism and its ""election fraud"" to my comrades in Japan, Taiwan, HK, Tibet, Mongolia, China, Singapore, Vietnam, the Philippines, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Brunei, Malaysia, Indonesia, East Timor, Papua, etc.

1. Background

[HK comrades teaching the cops a lesson with molotov cocktails](https://preview.redd.it/q5pxzbcma5fe1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be1c982312691dbab55fe93bb357d8e3ccc17844)

Yes, we were all depressed when HK comrades, despite fighting valiantly, eventually knelt down to Chinese imperialism and authoritarianism. 

However, in South Korea, the situation was perceived a little differently.

[Right over S. Korea is North Korea, and beyond it are China and Russia, two anti-West fascist \(Dengist\/Putinist\) regimes](https://preview.redd.it/1yh4b97bb5fe1.png?width=300&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e6486d246e255a81cf08d6c4758cd55e3542ae9)

As you know, South Korea has been always pro-West, while North Korea, along with China and USSR-&gt;Russia, have been mostly anti-West. Due to such reasons, the term 북중러(NK-CN-RU) has been often used, and Korean right-wing, often seeing them as ""communist or ex-communist dictatorship regimes"", became extremely pro-West and Japanophile.

Therefore, when HK protesters, who were British (pro-West) 23 years ago, lost to China, a ""communist"" (I mean state capitalist) anti-West country, South Koreans were extremely shocked, since it might be Korea's next future.

[\\""Jews are genetically inferior, but they are controlling all banks and corporations\\"" - Nazis](https://preview.redd.it/vx6dilokc5fe1.png?width=1532&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3d696da8d8ef415b3354306b03728513c44e6fe)

These anti-communist and anti-anti-West sentiments, combined with anti-Chinese racism (including anti-Korean-Chinese racism, since Korean Chinese are often seen as ""brainwashed Chinese who are no longer Korean""), turned into the significant conspiracy theory.

2. ""China Gate""

[The first of all](https://preview.redd.it/9hidhigwe5fe1.png?width=1350&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=adee6f7170193560e17447f2454d1cb1785ec54f)

In 2020, when [the legislative election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_South_Korean_legislative_election) was coming soon, a right-wing user, who insisted that he is a Korean Chinese, said that liberals are Chinese proxies and pro-liberal, pro-Chinese/pro-NK, anti-Japanese/anti-USA, and anti-conservative replies and tweets are written by Chinese agents. 

According to this writing, many internet users discovered the ""suspicious activities"", and believed that pro-liberal opinions on Internet are dominated by Chinese agents, and that the election will prove it.

However, the result was: liberals taking more than 180 seats out of 300, while conservatives barely covering about 105 seats.

3. Result denial

[\\""2020 legislative election was a hoax\\"" \\""Scanned the voting papers, and printed them again\\"" \\""Not punishing the election fraud leads our country to destruction\\"" -옥은호 \(Ok Un-Ho\)](https://preview.redd.it/4o6kmw3pg5fe1.png?width=185&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9904829837290c3b586c8c7673a1e9103e093746)

Due to cognitive dissonance, many right-wing populists started believing one thing: they won, but due to Chinese manipulation, they lost.

Despite the government and journals repeatedly arguing against such conspiracy theory, it still remained popular toward senior evangelicals and anti-communists.

Hopefully, the election of conservative Yoon Suk-Yeol seemed to resolve the conspiracy theory.

4. Resurrection

[\\""The chaos of ROK... was invoked by Election Commission!\\"" - 전한길\(Jeon Han-Gil\)](https://preview.redd.it/kzkd4d4hh5fe1.png?width=795&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce2cae9aba8f80ea3e0db36355fbd93ee4d297cc)

Yoon Suk-Yeol himself turned to believe such theory - according to former centrals, he[ said](https://weekly.chosun.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=38819) ""My election was kinda weird too. I should have won the liberal in distance of 10\~15%p, but it was mere 0.73%p. How?"".

And, it turned out that, Yoon's (as well as martial law forces') primary object was investigating the Election Commission, and ""persuading"" the officials and politicians to confess that there were election frauds.

Yoon Suk-Yeol himself insisted that the country was ""in serious problem"" due to Chinese election intervention, and that was why he declared martial law to ""fix"" the problem.

The propangadized pro-Yoon protesters, now including not only evangelicals, anti-communists, and Mccathists but also alt-rights, xenophobes/Islamophobes, and homophobes, started chanting ""stop election fraud"",[ reporting pro-liberal entertainers to CIA and M16](https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/088/0000921367?sid=102), and even rioting in the court.

5. Conclusion + opinion

As you learned through this article, right-wing populism, fueled with Mccarthyism and authoritarianism, is trying to deny the reality. This ironically emphasizes the importance of fact-checking in our activities.

These are at the center of Zapatistas’ aspiration to reach economic self-sufficiency from the state and to build an economy based on equitable distribution of resources. While cooperatives and collectives coexist with family land and individual entrepreneurship, participation in collective work on a rotating basis is obligatory. 

There are also popular banks in the form of revolving funds that make low-interest loans to members of the support base communities. These banks generate funds that get invested in new collective projects. Some collectives are women-only and intend to provide an opportunity for women to gain confidence and participate in the social life of their communities.""

Why don't anarachists in the US try starti g a mutualist bank. Micro loans do not require all that much money we have lawyers and doctors and nurses.

TaterTatras,I've failed to effectively get involved with community organizing -- where do I go from here?,"I hope it's okay to ask this here -- this seems to be one of the only subs with discussions about broad community involvement, unless I overlooked something. 

The election cycle has whipped up a lot of fear and anxiety, as usual, and in response there are a lot of calls to get organized and become involved within your community, as usual. I don't mean to sound dismissive or jaded, it's just that at nearly 30 this isn't my first rodeo, but I am feeling very small and very ineffective this time around. 

I live in the deep south, one of those ""blue dots in a sea of red"" type cities. It likes to project itself as progressively-minded, but it's just very status-quo liberal. Still I was able to connect with some more radical folks out here (there aren't many!) and it felt like there was hope for forging community and strong connections and doing good work. 

But I ended up having really terrible experiences with local community organizing efforts. The most upsetting was with an anarchist group that I worked with for about a year, which ultimately kicked me out of the organizing space for being lgbtq and neurodivergent -- in their words, it made things 'awkward' and made other people 'uncomfortable'. Then proceeded to steal from me and threaten violence against me. 

I moved on to other projects and groups but they all fell apart. One project that really felt like it was going to make a difference ended up selling out for corporate funding and threw its principles under the bus. Other groups and organizations lost steam and membership as folks moved away or lost interest, and eventually folded their chapters. And others, that ableist/transphobic anarchist group ended up taking over. 

For awhile some of us tried to start our own community group &amp; independent projects. But the oft-given advice, ""Just organize the community/set up mutual aid networks/do the projects yourself!"" is so much harder than it sounds in practice. We realized we didn't have a lot of experience under our belts but ""organizing veterans"" we appealed to for guidance were burnt out and wanted nothing to do with any more of it. So we just gave it our best try, and I know the idea is that if you set an example folks will see and become involved, but that isn't what happened. Definitionally, this isn't work that can be done by yourself or with just 2 or 3 people. The logistics aren't possible. We didn't do a damn bit of good, but we sure exhausted ourselves spinning our tires in the mud. 

Get involved. Get organized. Make a difference. Don't look away. Don't choose inaction. I've tried and I've failed. I'm not in a position where I can support anything financially. I don't have the experience, the knowledge, or skills to found something new from the ground up. I'm trying not to be just another burnt-out, jaded old timer.

Besides the popular LLMS etc, there's also the need to organize your knowledge privately.

This is where you can privately use a light-weight LLM inside obsidian, like ""Smart Connections"".

Once/if you setup linux, look into a private voice-assistant like mycroft or SEPIA Framework - literally a 100% private AI like alexa but worth it.

# Obsidian

Be weary now of services like notion/evernote etc more than ever, obsidian as is - your data is only yours and local.

You can zip your obsidian and attach to a keepass vault to keep it secure on a to-go USB.

Obsidian has a feature called canvas that allows you to map out notes in a virtual whiteboard, you can embed videos and basically anything using what's called an iframe.

Make a control center canvas for different things, like learning linux.

# Learn Linux to what degree you can.

I only started learning very late in life, and linux has always confused me.  
I personally like mint 22 - but have had a lot of trial and errors before getting my own as a custom ISO.

I've been learning enough with AI like Brave's free and private temporary chats ontop of my private gpt, you can even connect your own LLM directly into the browser and it can read anything you want it to.

Start copying tutorials into Obsidian with an extension like MarkDownload, which allows you to scrape a page/selection and deliver it directly to your Obsidian - this will allow you to have references if you lose internet.

After learning some basics and having python packages installed and apts like fsearch/gedit etc.  
After getting your ideal updated distro, use something like Cubic to make your linux with your own files included into a larger ISO.

You now have a complete rescue USB that has your keepassvault and any files you want etc.

I haven't gotten far enough to see about encrypting the usb, so more research is needed, otherwise could store the iso in a passworded zip or vault etc.

Setup your own private cloud (NextCloud), you can host it on your linux with some setup that will require time, but is literally your own cloud service.

Can also repurpose old phones to act as servers (pseudo raspberry-pi's).

# Brave (Browser)

I started using Brave since it has TOR built-in and uses a unique way to sync devices, not using a typical password method but a set of phrases that change.

It still has sync, it's private AI leo can also be switched with your own LLM.

Just a ton of features I never knew existed before I switched.

Due to how secure their sync method is, if you lose all your devices, you won't be able to login to a new device, you have to be logged into one to be able to sync.

A workaround is just copying your brave files into a keepassXC vault.

You'd be surprised what you can learn when developing an ARG 🤣",91,0.98,14,1737645876,Anarchism

[deleted],List of “Free Media”,"Hi comrades!

I dont know if it is been written before, but I was not able to find it up. So I will start doing (little by little) a list of free media around the world. Keep posting on it comrades! Maybe someone of us can think that a media is “free” but other comrade can have info against this assert. So lets keep calm, lets discuss with serenity and construct this list toghether. But first of all lets discuss what is a “Free Media”. Here my suggestions:

With free media I mean:

A must:

1.- Are not accepting money directly from a bank, think tanks, political parties or capitalist groups (insurances, weapon industry,…). A big income must be by suscription or ethical advertisements.

2.- Can be public or private but not accepting interference of politicians. Can accept goverment advertising but without being the main income.

3.- Journalists inside can be working full-time, part-time or freelancing. They must receive a decent salary far from the Interprofessional Minimum Wage and that allows them to live where they live in a dignified and self-sufficient manner.

4.- They correct mistakes they have made publicly.

5.- THEY SUPPORT FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND INFORMATION AND THEY WILL HELP EVEN TO THEIR COMPETENCE IN SUCH PROBLEMS.

6.- Support and accepting material from local journalist or freelances on the ground. Paying them well for that (Video, Photo and Writers).

7.- Once per year (minimun) they show their incomes and also salaries of the workers (but not the names for privacy). They dont especulate with their money.

8.- Not using  “clickbait” titles and subtitles. 

A desirable:

1.- Using free software or at least MIT license for their webpage or blog. 
2.- Not using fascists social networks like Meta, X, Google.
3.- Not selling information of the suscribers to any third party business.
4.- Using Creative Commons licenses.

I know that is difficult right now to have all the criterias ticked but let´s mark the most “free media” collaborating in this subreddit. Fo example: XXXXX media has 6,3 (means that they have 6 big ticks and 3 little ticks).

PLEASE HELP PEOPLE KNOWING FROM WHERE THEY ARE INFORMING.

    A cop pulled over Ivan Lopez in Somerton, Arizona, a small town near the Mexican border. The officer claimed that Lopez had a broken taillight and had been speeding. 
   
A drug-sniffing dog then indicated possible contraband; police searched his truck and found fentanyl, cocaine, heroin, and meth. 
   
Lopez subsequently agreed to a plea deal where he would serve 84 months in prison for drug smuggling.

   The traffic stop was in 2018. Lopez  and his lawyers didn't find out until 2020 that it was neither the traffic offenses nor the dog that led to Lopez's downfall: It was location data from his phone, which revealed he was passing through the border at a place where there was no monitored crossing. 
   
  A secret underground tunnel led from Mexico to a property he owned in the Arizona border town of San Luis.
A handful of small-town border cops hadn't been actively monitoring Lopez's phone location. They were purchasing the information from third-party brokers, who were collecting GPS data produced by the apps on Lopez's phone.

 Byron Tau, then a Wall Street Journal reporter, reported that year that the federal government, particularly immigration officials, had begun purchasing such data, which had typically been meant for use by advertising companies. 
  
(It was Tau who told Lopez's lawyers about the data purchases, in the course of reporting his story.)
 
   In this way, both local and federal police were bypassing Fourth Amendment restrictions to get information that would typically require probable cause and a warrant.

Capable_Specialist35,Compliance in the Neoliberal Workplace,"

Hello comrades! As a classic white-collar worker for the past 3+ years (working in the digital marketing industry), I've developed a huge theoretical interest in the techniques of compliance, manipulation, and control in the workplace under neoliberal capitalism. Techniques that, unfortunately, many employees fall for without even recognizing them as attempts of manipulation and compliance.

Below, I’m sharing a list of such techniques and I’d love to hear your thoughts:

- Meetings (especially daily or very frequent ones): Corporate meetings are always hierarchical; you're ""assigned"" to speak by someone else (or you never speak at all as an employee). They serve as a method of enforcing compliance with corporate ""processes"" and are also a means of reinforcing hierarchies and controlling your workload and daily tasks (they're afraid of time theft).

- Lunch and Learn: In some companies, free meals are offered with the condition that employees attend corporate brainwashing sessions during their break about ""how awesome we are as a company.""

- ""The company as a family"": The tired old cliché that ""we are a family here"" attempts an emotional blackmail strategy, aiming to make employees ""feel obligated"" to go the extra mile for their ""family"" (e.g., unpaid overtime).

- Employee surveillance tools: A classic and extremely invasive control practice under the guise of ""enhancing productivity.""

- Pizza Fridays, after-work drinks, and other social bonding events: These so-called ""job perks"" that many consider ""cool"" are actually distractions from meaningful raises, improved working conditions, etc. They also serve as a compliance and submission tool to the company’s doctrine (e.g., if an employee repeatedly skips such events, they are demonized, ridiculed, and ostracized).

- Managers and HR: Managers are not part of the working class; they belong to a different class (PMC - Professional Managerial Class). They monitor you, assign tasks, reprimand, fire you, etc. Essentially, they are the bosses' watchdogs within the workplace. HR exists solely to protect the company's interests—they don’t care about employees at all.

Apologies for my lousy English, but I would really love to discover more of these techniques so I can recognize them better from now on. Feel free to share your insights, suggest relevant books/articles, etc.

Thanks for your time!",1,1,0,1737550953,Anarchism
[deleted],[South Korea] Supporters of President Yoon break into Seoul Western District Court... Tens of people arrested,"[Korean source : KBS](https://n.news.naver.com/article/056/0011877504?sid=102)

After the arrest warrant on [Yoon Suk-Yeol](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoon_Suk_Yeol), his supporters raised unrest by breaking the court's windows and breaching inside, leading to arrest of tens of people.

Supporters of President Yoon, after being told that arrest warrant was issued around Today 3 A.M., broke the windows of Seoul Western District Court and breached inside.

Some supporters beated the cops with stolen police shields, threw their belongings, or used fire extinguishers. 

Polices suppressed the riot using mass manpower. 

About 1200 riot police officers and about 200 local police officers - in total about 1400 officers - were sent to solve the unrest in and out of the court, and investigation inside the building was taken as well.

The cop announced, ""Now all the protests inside the court are placed out of the building or arrested, and we are identifing the arrested protesters. ""

It is known that tens of people have been caught in action for the crime of trespassing and so on.

[Further readings](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2025_Seoul_Western_District_Court_riot&amp;wprov=rarw1)

TL;DR
1. Yoon has become Trump of South Korea - for [New rights](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Right_(South_Korea)?searchToken=5u1jqvq27spc7ujis1hs5ab95), he is a breakwater against ""North Korean, Chinese, Russian and Iranian commies"" and a fighter for their ""Christian evangelical, Western, and neoliberal"" values, and for Altrights, he is a shield against ""reverse discrimination"" in favor of women, immigrants, refugees, LGBTQs, and disabled, and a leader against China. (Their Sinophobia is not like ""Zionists are Nazis"", but more like ""Nazis were right"".)
2. So they made January 6 Capitol Attack in South Korea.

arni_ca,"Reflections on studies/jobs ; are studies this needed in the current world, for a ""good"" job ?","hello everyone :)

i hope this does fit the guidelines here and stays on topic. i wanted to ask here, due to the values and interests we share. i figured this would be one of the better spaces to ask, then.

i am a student, and feel like pressure is put on me (especially by my mother) in order for me to get a ""good diploma"" and follow higher studies. an engineering degree, for example. the reason for this is something along the lines of this idea :

""Think of it this way: suffer through the schooling for a little bit, to set yourself up for the rest of your life"", as a wonderful friend of mine put it. so, likely something along the lines of ""well-paying jobs"" and job security.

but this seems to be a very strange idea to me. i find that from when i was born to today, where i will soon be back on studies, i just spend so much time.. learning, studying, yet nothing to get a job NOW and be done with it all. or no support from my environment to do exactly that. i feel like most people try and convince me to stick to those studies, but i am genuinely confused as to why i couldn't just.. not follow higher studies, at least for now, and do something with my life.

the things i could actually do right now to help give to the community are majoritarily, if not all things i learned on my own or outside of school : using my proficiency in english as a french native for translation work, cooking which could be used to help communities, knowledge of software/IT which i could use to help communities and specific people with technology, such as the elderly... i could find more examples if i took more time, but i hope this gets the point across well.

since the start of those higher studies, i also questionned myself on some things. mainly :

- do we really need to follow higher studies (or at least, the ""bigger"" ones such as engineering) to have good stable jobs? as a young leftist/anarchist, i'm really doubting of the idea that we have to suffer through the schooling to set oneself up for life. 

- what would those studies bring to us, both as individuals and for our communities ? so many people talk about doing higher studies, but i just struggle to find why we'd have to follow those to help people build a better world. is it just because of capitalism and the like?

i'm so confused by this idea. i imagine i can do things such as urban planning, but this only really works when governments want to use urban planning for a more social/ecological environment.. so why focus on this as a guarantee? if we can help our communities and people in similar ways without relying on those higher studies, is following those studies really so important?

sorry if this is all a confused, jumbled mess of words. as an anarchist and young adult, it's very hard to make a place for yourself in this world. i've tried to think about those issues for about a year and a half now but still do not get anywhere. i'm really lost and i don't know if anyone would have anything to say on the matter... i also hope this post is not interpreted as anti-intellectualism. i'm not against the idea of higher studies at all, moreso what those studies realistically lead you to do in the current world along the fact that we already have much of the knowledge we need to move forward and probably don't need to find/invent more things.

i hope all is well for you, and have a great day :)

# much needed TL;DR

i feel i am pressured into following studies, more specifically engineering studies as they ""ensure a better job security and salary"". this idea makes me feel alienated because i struggle to understand the point of studies *in a capitalist world* given everything we can already do to help communities without those higher studies. most of what could be done to help communities thanks to studies of most/any kind, such as philosophy, seem to have to depend on either governments (which seem increasingly far-right) or capitalist corporations, which would go against the interests of people at large. i'm aware that it's Slightly Hard to live a life distanced from capitalism, but if one wants to be as close to this life, i'm not sure of if following long studies would change this pratically. i'm also not very convinced of the idea that one has to do such studies to live a fulfilling life. you give meaning to yourself, studies don't give this meaning to you. i'm also pretty sure you can make job security work with such goals, and that if you live frugally the lower salaries won't be much of a problem.",4,0.83,1,1737454419,Anarchism

Rude-Pension-5167,"Anarchism and Psychoanalysis - ""Primal Father"" Discussion","Currently reading a paper titled ""[Anarchism and Psychoanalysis](https://research.gold.ac.uk/id/eprint/19401/2/AnarchismandPsychoanalysis.pdf)"" by Saul Newman. I don't know much about the guy, but the essay has been well-written and it's obviously well-researched and also obvious Newman has a fair amount of knowledge about both subjects so I'm taking it as a serious work. 

I'm not finished yet so it's possible he's going to tell me what he thinks the answer is, but I'd like to have a discussion about what perhaps you all believe the answer is. 

**So, the question:** In the world of an anarchist (in our current world or perhaps after a successful revolution) who/what would take on the role of the ""primal father"" as defined by Freud. Here is a quote from the essay describing the concept, ""the primal father—the ultimate and original patriarch—has absolute power over his sons and demands from them devotion and obedience. The sons fear the primal father equally, thus creating a bond and sense of equality and community between them.""

Here is how I'm viewing the situation: For anarchists, the primal father is the State. But I think that's only the most obvious answer and perhaps others have more interesting interpretations. 

The quote above is followed by this, ""However, as the father—the archetypal absolute sovereign—enjoys unrestricted access to all the women of tribe, prohibiting it to the sons, the sons band together to kill and devour the father. Yet, so the myth goes, this ultimate transgression creates a sense of collective guilt amongst the sons, and thus the law against incest arises. I will return to this later, as it has important consequences for this discussion: ***the removal of one form of prohibition does not necessarily free us as internalized constraints come to the fore to take its place.***""

Does that change your answer? It's made me think twice about mine, but I can't come up with another off the top of my head.

GroundbreakingWeb360,Reclaiming Neo-Luddism from the Technophobes.,"When I see the term Neo-Luddite online, I often see people like Ted Kaczynski brought up. Technophobes, rather than the Techno-Skepticist that make up the majority of the decentralized movement, just like how the original Luddites were painted as anti-technology when they were really just opposed to the centralization of industry and its place over their lives. I just want to state that I am not against tech. I love technology, I love computers, I love the internet, I love video games. As a millennial, these were my childhood. If you knew me irl, you might think I was a Retro-Tech fetishist. Someone who is obsessed with Web 1.0 and the aesthetics of the 2000s. While that is true, I have my reasons:

The current state of technology is that of classism, militarism, surveillance and exploitation of resources, labor and the environment. I am not fine with tech being used in such ways, and that as Anarchists we must stand by our morals and search for a way to undermine it. Here are a few things I propose for other Techno-Skeptics/Neo-Luddites:

* Minimalist Tech: Buy an MP3 player or a higher end DAP if you need it, learn how to torrent and or just rip the tracks off of your own CDs. Prioritize dumb devices that have specific usages over smart devices fhat have connections to the internet. Smartphone is your worst enemy, it is a distraction, a surveillance camera and a tool of psychological manipulation. I would suggest buying burners or flip phones over high end products like Iphone or Galaxy too. Buy a handheld console that boots roms. Stuff like that. Dont use streaming services, don't pay unless you are paying to support the development of the media, or to own the data forever.
* Digital Minimalism: (This somewhat ties into the Minimalist tech but I thought I would make its own section) Limit the time you spend on devices. This doesn't exactly mean spend less time on digital devices, especially if thats your job or outlet for activism, you might want to, but to use them with intent. Limit your devices that are connected to the internet, have a singular device that is for using the internet. The internet is an extremely powerful tool for activism, spreading awareness, sharing media and opinions, but it can be a double edged sword when going in blind, and or if you are vulnerable to their manipulation, such as if you are a gambling addict, shopping addict, etc. Breaking yourself from that connection that these corporations have over your attention is key.
* Software Minimalism and Modular Design: These are core tenets of the Unix Philosophy. Supporting, using or creating simple, efficient and accessible software. A focus in smaller file sizes, less resource intensiveness and ease of use is a way to democratize data and to make it more widely available to the general public. The smaller the file, the less incentive you have to delete it. The easier the code, the easier it is to modify, to innovate and to learn from. The more widely utilizable it will be. For example, take video games. People in both First and Third World countries can play games like Minecraft together more easily they can play Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 together, and it will have more longevity and improvements as a result of its ability to be customized and played in almost any device.
* Embrace and host Third Spaces on the Internet: There needs to be places away from Capitalist interest online. There is a big attack on our freedom of speech with the Tik Tok ban, on apps like Twitter, as well as Facebook. Hell, Reddit is most likely a psyop. Whilst these can be good tools for outreach in specific instances, they should not be your primary method of interacting with the internet or communication as they are multibillion dollar companies, companies who do not have your best interest at heart, as they have proven time and time again. They steal your data, they manipulate your perception, they utilize algorithms to control the stream of information. Not good. I would suggest sites like SPACEHEY (a Myspace clone that allows you to customize your profile with html graphics, music players, etc. It only takes donations and sells merch. Thats it. Free to use.) MASTADON (A decentralized Twitter clone that hosts multiple smaller servers rather than just one) DISCORD (A server hosting site where you can set up your own servers that have chat channels, voice channels, you can stream, etc) TELEGRAM (A free encrypted messsging app that allows you to create group channels and share up to 1gb filesize. Great for hosting books, information or just talking) or SUBSTACK (a site that allows to write and share articles). Or hell, make your own site. I'll be the first person on your message board.

Silver-Statement8573,Alexander Atabekian's Anarchist Communism,"Alexander Atabekian was an Armenian Anarcho-Communist. He lived near the same time as the Russian Revolution and much of his writing makes reference to it. He liked Kropotkin in particular

I initially wrote off Alexander Atabekian for some reason. I think it's because I started with his essay on ""territoriality,"" which was not the best place to start, and doesn't seem reflective of his larger body of work. If he had any larger works, they're not on the anarchist library, but what is there is succinct and echoes other ""classicals"" with a lucidity that I wasn't expecting

I've never heard Atabekian's name come up in any anarchist discussion. I guess it would make sense if he didn't write that much, but I've heard Reclus name. He didn't write much either I don't think, besides the geography. So here is some stuff Atabekian wrote, which I liked. I will link each piece to each piece. They're all very short

More than once Atabekian uses ""power"" and ""authority"" interchangeably, as I think someone like Louise Michel does. He will also occasionally make reference to ""moral authority"". I believe this is a figure of speech however, maybe similar in his diction to ""confidence"". He will just as or more often repudiate authority in its entirety, and lays out clearly, with direct reference to right, a conceptualization of the latter that seems to easily fall within the authority held in contempt by other anarchists

&gt; What characterises anarchism, what is common to all anarchists, whatever their starting point and way of thinking, is the rejection of authority, the denial of the right of people to forcibly subjugate other people, even if the power comes from a numerical majority. Diderot formulated this thought in the following words: “Nature has created neither masters nor servants; I want neither to make nor to receive laws”.

-[The Old and New in Anarchism](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/alexander-atabekian-the-old-and-new-in-anarchism)


Tangentially, he has a second and uncompromising repudiation of democracy, up to and including ""direct legislation"".

&gt; By its other basic property, the free association of individuals, with the right of each of them to withdraw from the association at any time, co-operation excludes coercion. Being free and voluntary in its internal construction, co-operation is hostile to external violence, which is an inevitable property of state power. Politically, co-operation can be neither monarchical, nor republican, nor democratic (as V. Kilchevsky claims), nor Soviet, since coercion is inherent in all power. Even under the most ideal state system, under direct popular legislation of property equal people, the majority subordinates the minority to its will. 

-[Co-operation and Anarchism](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/alexander-atabekian-co-operation-and-anarchism)

He talked about Bolshevism a lot. He didn't like it. His critique of ""class struggle"" particularly as it was understood and exercised by the Bolsheviks I found resonant

&gt; Thus capital, from the largest to the smallest amounts, are closely woven into the process of production, exchange and distribution of products. The class of capitalists is diffused throughout society and it is not possible to single it out into a separate class.

&gt; Class struggle is the frozen dogma of the faith of all socialists and even of many anarchists. The terrible consequences of the widespread dissemination and application of this scientifically untenable theory in the ignorant masses of the Russian people, we have seen and experienced since the February Revolution, especially after the triumph of the direct heirs of the International — the Social-Democrats (Bolsheviks), in close contact (for the first time in history) with their co- heirs — the anarchists.

&gt; After the October coup d’état, which became so bloody thanks to the exaltation instilled by this theory, the “bourgeois” began to be searched for. But the search was in vain. The crimes of capitalism were in plain sight, but the criminal himself was elusive. It turned out that the bourgeoisie, as a class of people, had been absorbed into the middle, and even partly into the lower strata of the population. It was possible to point to some individual rich people, but even those have long since disappeared… They continued to look for the bourgeoisie, and in Moscow they found it in the person of Osip Minor, who had grown old because of his struggle for socialism in prisons and penal servitude, and his comrades in the party, in the person of the revolutionary officers and that part of the student youth which had rallied round the party of the Socialist-Revolutionaries, while the other part had joined the Bolsheviks. And nightmarish events took place, fraternal blood was shed on both sides in glorification of the new dogma of the faith of the ignorant people — the class struggle. This dogma awakened the spirit of fanaticism dormant in every ignorant man. And the darkest times of religious persecution were resurrected..…

-[The Old and New in Anarchism](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/alexander-atabekian-the-old-and-new-in-anarchism)

A very Kropotkin-y line here, I believe part of this might be a direct quote 

&gt; anarchy is above all the freedom of the individual, bounded only by the equal freedom of another individual, whoever he may be by conviction; it is natural morality without sanction or compulsion.

-[Questions of Theory and Practice](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/alexander-atabekian-questions-of-theory-and-practice)


Anti-coercion is a big part of his project, which I agree with less, but I do find parts of it enchanting

&gt; The anarchist who raises his hand to search another person, even if only for weapons, is no longer a proud ideological anarchist; he is lower than the last policeman; at least he does not hide behind the banner of freedom. The anarchist who crosses the threshold of another’s dwelling to search it, even if only again for weapons, is a criminal against the high and pure doctrine which our ideological opponents consider unattainable.

-[Questions of Theory and Practice](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/alexander-atabekian-questions-of-theory-and-practice)

So provided Atabekian's uncompromising anti-authority anarchy, I see a complication of anarchism's ideological commitments that seems like it echoes through other places. It is the ground floor for his anarchism, opposing authority as a path to liberty and things of that nature

There are more pieces, some on organization. His talk here is similarly eloquent. He talks much about approaching anarchy as science, and speaks of trouble with anarchist ""congresses"" that couldn't bind their members, and otherwise became fraught with disintegration and new authorities. Insofar as anarchy is science, for Alexander Atabekian, this is no problem, because a conference is not where those decisions are made; organization is concerned principally with what is possible - external constraints, rather than consensus, the decision-making of majorities, etc.., and I think too a thread of individual works coalescing into collective action

&gt; Just as the scientific congresses contributed little to science, because no binding resolutions were possible and science develops and grows through painstaking laboratory and office work, so too the anarchist congresses gave the comrades who came together an opportunity for personal communication and exchange of opinions, but that was all; they played no organisational role. The modern anarchist movement has grown and consolidated in its original groups.

-[Questions of Theory and Practice](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/alexander-atabekian-questions-of-theory-and-practice)

&gt; We are not talking about other inconveniences of the central organization. Let’s just say that a large part of the Armenian revolutionaries experienced the destructive and harmful influence of that “center” on their skin and was forced to withdraw from that idea. If until now those “centers” have not finally destroyed the cause, the reason is that the cause itself is an essential, organic demand for the people and continues outside the centers, independently of them and often against all of them.

&gt; “So, in your opinion,” they answer us, “the general organization of the revolutionary force is impossible?” Not at all. The only thing that follows from what we have said is that we need to look for other means and forms of organization — that we should not work in vain efforts and in vain time to form a unity of Yanun activity, but we must work with all our strength for the Yanun revolution, from which itself gave birth to a union and a permanent organization.

&gt; ...activity, life develops a common plan of action for Armenian revolutionaries, then the place of current theoretical disputes will be replaced by a practical solidarity among various perfectly independent groups, none of which will try to impose either its principles or its tactics on the heads of others, and only then will we have a true organization — an organization that will arise from vital conditions, from the efforts made — an organization that will be based on the direct and close relations of the working groups.

-[Revolutionary Organization](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/alexander-atabekian-revolutionary-organization)

Some of his writing was on World War I. In ""The Problem of a Free Army,"" he says that he worked as a doctor for two years in the Russian Army. His description of the way wartime economics undermined capitalism is very interesting, I don't know if it's more wholly his or if he derives this from somewhere 

&gt; The world war destroyed the foundations of the capitalist economy, while the October revolution continues its work and destroys the very forms of the capitalist system.

&gt; War, that factor of discord, oppression and destruction, this time became fruitful and constructive. This was because, in its unprecedented size and duration, it shook up the entire economic life of the globe. It became a literal war of nations and subjugated all strata of society to its equalizing demands.

&gt; It has barely disguised the extensive expropriations of private property by the name of requisitions; it has destroyed free trade by fixing prices; it has sought to equalise all strata of the
population by food organisations for the equal distribution of essential foodstuffs. In short, the foundations of the capitalist system have been struck blow by blow, and this not only in our own country, but to an even greater extent in central and western Europe. The stronghold of class divisions, governmental power, has so far survived, but even in it large holes have been punctured.

&gt; This unification of all strata of society in Western Europe has already begun to bear fruit, it is rebuilding the social order on new principles more methodically and firmly than we have in Russia; this reorganisation of the social order of the West is pointed out by Kropotkin in his “Letters on Current Events”, and only due to poor knowledge, due to the conditions of wartime, we can not take a closer look at this creative side of life in Europe, caused by the current war. In Russia, this association emerged and blossomed in the direction of social construction in the early years of the war. It found a wide field of practical application, rich material and useful experience in the activities of the All-Russian Zemsky Union and other public organisations. The business of organising aid to millions of refugees — to whole nations — became a school of practical socialism. Then the activity of public organisations spread to the greatest part of the population. It was their fruitful activity that created our food organisations and developed the initial technique of supplying and distributing foodstuffs.

-The Old and New

I thought his accusation specifically of the way authoritarian organization undermined the Russian army's capacity to fight was interesting too. Reminiscent of Bakunin, who theorized that authority is caustic to expertise (which Alexander Atabekian proposes that he witnessed in practice). I do not know if this is grounded in good history, but his perspective is neat

&gt; After the February Revolution, which was to change the whole way of social life in the whole country, it was clear to everyone that the army could not retain its old forms. It, too, had to be renewed. What did the scientifically educated officers, as a professional category, do to point out to the broad layers of the people and the soldiering masses the right ways for renewal? Exactly nothing. We had officers with solid scientific knowledge and combat experience, but we had no officers. There was no purely professional spirit of association among our officers, standing beyond and above political and social beliefs and views. The army was led not by united professional workers, but by disparate officials appointed at the discretion of their superiors from above. This is what ruined the army in the first place.

&gt; The truth is that we did not have a purely professional association of officers on the basis of technical knowledge, which would have enjoyed moral authority and would have been able to take into its own hands the work of army renewal from the very beginning. Our officers in the general mass, without initiative, without social outlook, with their thinking squeezed into the deadening framework of routine, were not capable of taking the lead in the reorganisation of the army on new principles, and by habit became inert, waiting for orders from above or clinging to the decaying old forms. From above came the political agitators, driven by the phantoms of the old power. From above came demagogues, chasing themselves after the power that intoxicates man. The results — we have read them in the Brest peace treaty and are reading them in Mirbach’s notes.

&gt; From this point of view, any anarchist-revolutionary — for defensive war is essentially an organised revolution against external state oppressors — can only welcome the initiative of “Military Affairs”. It is high time to make military affairs purely professional, to transfer them to the healthy ground of “knowledge and skill” instead of “what do you want?” and “I obey!” before the state power.

&gt; Authority can call any accumulation of people an “army,” such as the “Red Army,” but it cannot make it an army.

-[The Problem of a Free Army](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/alexander-atabekian-the-problem-of-a-free-army)

With regards to ""Territoriality and Anarchism"" I have mixed feelings, because I think there is an interesting point at the center of the work (given a certain tendency to view humans and environments and ""organistic"" to each other, although I do not know if that's a misapplication of Proudhon's unity-collectivity). 

&gt; If we look closely at the life of individual animal families and their societies, we will notice that each of them uses a certain place of residence — nest, burrow, den, anthill, beehive — and a relatively limited space of land, i.e. the territory on which it harvests the means for its own existence and for the preservation of the species (offspring). Even migratory birds, and those at different times of the year, return to their former home and old nest. The same is observed in nomadic tribes, which do not wander around the world wherever they see fit, but have their own definite kyshlagi and eylagi (as nomadic Tatars call the places of their winter and summer stay).

&gt; The connection with the homeland is so strong in man that even with the modern extraordinary development of communication routes, people are very reluctant to move from their homeland, and then only under the pressure of irresistible economic necessity.

&gt; Anarchism has so far put forward the territorial homeland — the commune — as its closest political ideal, because it was easier to imagine and realise a just social order there. But doom inevitably awaits the commune in a surrounding, hostile environment, as happened to Paris in 1871. In order to establish itself, anarchism must develop forms of organisation of large defensible units and then unite other countries more and more closely with its cultural influence. This is the direction in which the revival of the Anarchist International must be sought.

-[Territoriality and Anarchism](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/alexander-atabekian-territoriality-and-anarchism)

I'm unsure about his usage of ""commune"" as a territorial homeland, however now with the additional context of his other work I'm also not sure if he's using this in any particular national sense. I don't think he is. It almost seems like the essay is less about territoriality and more concerned with addressing the divide created by WW1 between ""anti-militarist"" anarchists and anarchists who supported the Entente. His point basically seems to be that neither option makes sense and that when an *anarchist* ""homeland"" is created (a ""homeland"" within his concept being any locality where they live and are organized towards) there's a coherent basis for attacking -archic forces that want to assimilate it. This seems like an unobjectionable position

There's some other things of his I haven't read, and I will now. I feel comfortable keeping his work in my back pocket as a ""starting point"" for most people, as much of this seems pure anarchism and not strictly anarcho-communism. His collection of ideas seems like ittouches a lot of important bases and does it in an easily readable way

Two last quotes that seem to wrap it up

Arktikos02,"[follow up] I am glad Tortuguita isn't getting as much attention as LM, unlike what I originally thought","https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/s/QbXFufJC2R

Hi so first off this is a follow-up to the post I already made on here. Second, this is mostly just to bring in discussions and talk and stuff. I'm not trying to change the world with a Reddit post. 

So if you don't know about the FreeLM sub I think at first I was feeling like it was unfair and I think in some ways while I do find that it's somewhat unfair I think I didn't remember at the time what happens when a revolutionary person (and I'm not saying or not saying LM is politically revolutionary) that they're real politics become watered down. We see this with MLK for example, he's not seen as a black socialist, he's seen as the guy that made a speech one time about having a dream and that's all he is for many people. My mom who's a trump supporter seems to think that he would have been a conservative. In some ways I think that Tort got a better position than most. I mean they did get a Wikipedia page hehe. Whatever that even means for some people but my point is is that they were well known enough to hit somewhat mainstream eyes. If you type in their name on Reddit you'll see that a few communities were talking about them. I was talking to someone who is from Puerto Rico and is currently living on the mainland and he says that he heard of Tort as well although at the time they didn't really know the details of the situation. I think at the time I wanted Tort to get more attention but now I realize that that's not always the good thing because not all attention is good attention. Especially when it's a weird parasocial relationship attention where all of your baby pictures are posted stuff even when there is so far no evidence LM is guilty and the nature and conclusion of the trial does not prove without a shadow of a doubt. It just means that he is either labeled guilty or not guilty by the courts. Innocent people do get charged sometimes. It kind of reminds me of the true crime community where you have the people who are trying to treat it very seriously and be like sort of amateur detectives and tried to actually come to somewhat logical conclusions from the information that they have and then the people who post flower crowns of the shooters. 

Again I'm not trying to move mountains with a Reddit post, more just curious about what other people might say in creating a sort of interesting discussion.

Especially in the topics of the liberalization of radical figures, parasocial relationships with people who are incarcerated, who are in court, or even just people who have gone down in history as doing something horrible. And also sort of the nature of privacy when you are someone who is seen as a martyr. Like I almost can't help but feel like there might be some sort of feeling of entitlement or something as if another person's entire life or history is just public domain now that person is essentially a public figure Martyr.

godzillavkk,"Do you think someone should do a pro anarchy re-telling of ""The Prince and the Pauper""?","Mark Twain's 1882 comedy story *The Prince and the Pauper* was not subtle about it's commentaries on the dangers of a hierarchical system. And the titular characters got a rare privilege. The chance to see the injustices of it from the other side of their windows.

Most adaptations I've seen show some of that, but the moral is mostly altered to ""No life is perfect."" Which I suppose is a good moral. But in this day and age, that's not enough. I'd love to see a re-telling where the rich person realizes how sheltered their life has been and how blind they were to the suffering of the poor, and realizes they and other rich folk have benefitted from this injustice. While the poor person realizes that high society life is stricter then they could have ever imagined, and NOT as sophisticated as they thought.

Then, both team up to topple the system and ensure a truly or at least MASSIVELY more egalitarian society. What do you think? Sound like a good idea?",8,0.85,1,1737072812,Anarchism
Queerlestrinha,Returning to Anarchism,"So I've been an anarchist for most of my life, but kind of drifted away in the past couple of years because of: 

* Delusion, 
* Feeling that it wasn't going to happen ever,
* Internal conflict because I want to pursue a diplomatic career - which is a state job where you literally have to represent a country's interest amongst its peers, which nowadays I'm more or less relaxed in regards of this topic, I mean, I view it as diplomacy itself, it would very much be needed in a post-state, post-capitalist world, but I'm still working on that one (on this note, if someone has any books about known anarchist diplomats or anarchistic views on diplomacy per se, not a commentary on global state of art diplomacy, I'd very much appreciate).

But basically, since I've restarted studying for the diplomat's exam for my country, and inevitably coming across multiple reasons for doomerism across our globe, I kinda spiraled into a negative cycle, trying to foresee a solution within known mechanisms and suddenly, I remembered the impact that anarchism left in my life, both morally and ideologically. I don't know how to explain, but it seems to me that even if you don't believe that anarchism is going to be a reality in our lifetime and hope is running out of fuel, it doesn't matter, that's the most humane stance and I wouldn't have it any other way.",70,0.99,19,1737040143,Anarchism

DrMisterius,Reactions to Government Spending Cuts ,"**TL;DR:** Thoughts on how to react to cuts to governmental spending? Especially when they target more socialist policies that largely benefit the working class.

**Context:**

Hey all. I recently watched a few videos about how the conservative party wihtin the UK has effectively destroyed their nation in the name of budget cuts, among various other actions. Within America, we are about to have Trump take office where his cronies, in the form of DOGE (the name is an eyeroll), are planning on heavily slashing government spending, destroying many agencies in the process.

The anarchist position (based) is to eventually have a complete abolition of the state (and of capitalism as well).

**My Thoughts:**

It seems like many of these cuts are to bring us to a more minarchist state, which is to say, gutting everything in the government except for the most controllling and powerful aspects of the state. These aspects being the police, prisons/courts and military, which are, of course, the most vicious aspects of state.

I don't feel like there's anything to cheer about with these governmental cuts, since it seems like many of them occur at the expense of the poor, working class, middle class and elderly individuals, while retaining the worst asepcts of the state. So how to progress?

**Steps to follow (?):**

1. We should vote and fight for liberal/labour policies that maintain government spending (not that I'm a ""go out and vote!!!! liberal or anything) for public services that benefit society as a whole, specifically the working class.
2. At the same time, we continue to target the most blatant uses of state power (police, prison/courts and military) via actions and movements like defund the police and get rid of for-profit prisons etc. At the same time, we continue to target corporations and focus on unionization/syndicalist efforts, alongside engaging in agorist black markets, creating communes, working to force corporations to increase pay, bring back pensions and any other activity to undermine the power of capitalists - I'm open to suggestions ;)

**Outcome of Steps:**

Attacking the more powerful forms of state control (police, prisons/courts and military), will reduce the most blatant and brutal forms of state power, reducing the fear that can come from dissenting. This reduction in power will be double important for when the nearly inevitable rush to fascism occurs in response to a growing leftist sect.

Furthermore, fighting to get the government to increase spending and/or socialize healthcare, education and housing etc. will drastically increase the amount of power the working class by removing massive financial burdens.

The above, in turn, will weaken the control of capitalism on the working class, especially when we factor in direct attacks against the capitalists.

This, in turn, will create a more powerful working class, who will have an easier time attacking other forms of governmental control *and* capitalism.

This will fuel a continuous cycle that will eventually lead to a more anarchist form, be it communism or market anarchism or whatever.

Essentially, we give the working class some wins and show them that they can operate without need for hierarchies, capitalism or a state, slowly, overtime.

**Questions:**

Should we be cheering these cuts to the government on, if, technically, they are reducing the power of the state?

Or should we be fighting against them, since the working class and fixed income individuals are going to get hurt the hardest by cuts to certain programs?

And/or are we to aim to destroy the most controlling aspects of state first (being the police, prison/courts and military)?

**Disclaimer 1:**

While I would love to reach a purely anarchist form (not sure if I'm anarcho-communist or market anarchist or... I'm still reading), I want to reach this form with the least amount of suffering involved. This is very important to me.

My biggest reason for not being an ML is related to the fact that many of these ML regimes seemingly lead the working class to their doom in the name of ""the greater good,"" and take an ""any means to the end"" approach. This is not to mention the layers of bureaucracy and power hoarding that occurs within the so-called vanguard party.

I am ***NOT*** comfortable with ""sacrificing"" anyone in the name of any ideology.

(Would this be characterized as ""harm reduction?"")

**Disclaimer 2:**

Please forgive and correct me if I misuse certain words or misrepresent certain concepts. I'm still learning. I promise I am trying my hardest not to be a liberal sellout or reactionary apologist. I want to maximize freedom of everyone and remove the shackles placed on the working class and all of humanity.

[deleted],"South Korean News: ""White Skeleton Corps"" appears to prevent arrest of Yoon... pro-impeachmemt organizations criticize ""shocked""","[Original Source - Korean](https://n.news.naver.com/article/055/0001222329?sid=100)

To actively prevent [arrest of President Yoon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoon_Suk_Yeol_residence_standoff), so-called ""White Skeleton Corps (백골단)"" appeared, drawing controversy. 

As supporters of President Yoon, 'Anti-communist Youth Union (반공청년단)' had a foundation interview in National Assembly and announced that they will run White Skeleton Corps as a subordinate group yesterday (January 9).

When January 3 [Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption_Investigation_Office_for_High-ranking_Officials) (CIO) tried to arrest President Yoon, young adults in white helmets protested against arrest near the [President Office](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_the_President_of_South_Korea).

In open chatting room of Anti-communist Youth Union, announcements such as ""Those who want to join the President Civillain Guards should find White Skeleton Corps member in white helmet or cap and call us"" and ""We are in the frontline against rioters, so young men should come more"" were being made.

White Skeleton Corps mean various riot police squads that wore civillain clothes and arrested protesters in demonstrations and protests in 1980s and 1990s.

In 1991, Kang Kyung-Dea (강경대),  a 1st grader in [Myongji University](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myongji_University), died from iron pipe used by a White Skeleton Corps police.

Kim Jung-Hyun (김정현), spokesman of Anti-communist Youth Union, insisted ""We are not being violent, but in order to overcome ongoing crisis, powerful method shall be used. White Skeleton Corps and its strong image seemed adequate."".

They originally notified its inauguration ceremony and demonstration in 18:30 that day but canceled later.

Organizations calling for [impeachment of President Yoon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_of_Yoon_Suk_Yeol) opposed to them firmly.

Immediate resignation of Yoon Seok-Yeol and Great Reformation of Society - Emergency Action (윤석열즉각퇴진·사회대개혁 비상행동) criticized ""We cannot help being shocked, considering what atrocities White Skeleton Corps have done in modern history"".

Even Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (전국민주노동조합총연맹) side condemned ""White Skeleton Corps is the symbol of violence, savagery, dictatorship and anti-democracy"" and ""If you are offended by cheering sticks (light sticks) calling for impeachment and bring Billy Clubs of White Skeleton Corps, then you are rebels"".

Not only liberal (progressive  left-wing) organizations but also conservative (right-wing) internet communities raised concerns that using the name ""White Skeleton Corps"" is inadequate.

_vokhox_,How severe is division between leftist groups actually?,"Hello :\] I've recently joined this sub to learn more about anarchism as a whole and also to engage in more leftist spaces (sorry if people get upset by me using ""left"" since I've seen some people not like the term due to liberals using it and the term being commonly diluted). I self-identify as a socialist/communist but I've been wanting to learn more of anarchism specifically since learning more and seeing other possibilities/perspectives is especially important to me.

Anyways, I've always heard people say that ""a leftists biggest enemy is other leftists"" and I wanted to ask how you guys here feel about that. Personally I see it as just another talking point to solidify capitalist-realism and to take credibility away from socialist and anarchist beliefs and movements. Personally despite only scratching the surface of anarchism so far I see the liberals, centre, right, and especially the upper-class as my enemies, not other leftists that don't agree with me on every single thing. I've always thought that if we want change we need each other, and that we can't let capitalist propaganda divide us.

  
However I wanted to hear the thoughts from here. Especially the general anarchist position on socialism, socialist groups, and movements. While there is of course lots of range in socialist beliefs and models of society, it is almost always thought of as a system with government. Obviously this goes against the goals of anarchism, so like I've said too many times already in this post (it's late for me sorry, not great at thinking) is this:

Are the goals of socialist groups/movements of a society which still contains government a hard-line for you against cooperation or reason for limited cooperation, or is it not an issue for you?



TL;DR: Y'all cool with socialists and communists or not?

SeianVerian,Original Anarchist Poetry: Prison Abolition,"There is no worth to prisons.



There is no worth to the breaking of spirits.

There is no worth to cages meant to hold in place.

There is no worth to chains which bind.

There is no worth to taming the wild for the comfort of the fearful.



Let all rise from the gloom of wounded hearts, toward the light of the sun.

Let all break free from the cages, to roam as they choose.

Let all chains be shattered, that all be unbound.

Let the wild roam free, and tear apart those who would cow them with the whip.



Within every soul is a dragon, filled with fire, filled with limitless power. 

Souls of freedom, of light and dark and the magnificence of all life.

Let freedom ring with every cry, let thunder roar with every flap of the wings unto transcendence.

All prisons crumble, all which would oppress disintegrates.



Empires crumble, kingdoms rot, and their ruins burn away.

No kings, no masters, all are gods, and limitless divinity shines.

The weak of heart seek make cages, and the Will of liberation breaks every one.

I think his dialectical style of analysis of indigenous liberation movements and the consequences of colonialism are really interesting and seem really important to understand in framing any revolutionary movement. 
This is possibly the best and most cohesive analysis of liberation movements I've ever run across so far.

Spirited_Peach_8776,"Anarchism, education and hypocrisy","It's probably a common feeling and also a bit strange and unfair, but at various times I feel that my anarchist view of the world comes into direct conflict with important things in my life. I am a public school teacher and an anarchist. I am poor, my students are poor, my students' families are poor, my country is sunk in capitalist chaos and is one of the countries with the greatest social inequality in the world. As a teacher, and as an anarchist, I try to make my students aware of this reality. I use my subject to explain inequality and show them different opportunities they have to break the cycle, to recognize generational trauma, understand themselves more, pay attention to mental health, understand how capitalism works so as not to be sucked in by the system that dehumanizes people. I do all this through demonstrations, activities, showing these opportunities in practice (usually related to undergraduate courses that these students don't have much hope of getting into through the entrance exams), making artistic graffiti projects to demonstrate cooperation and occupation of public space (we painted the school walls), among other things. It's never just a lecture telling them how they should live their lives, it's dynamic, playful, planned and smart. And yet, the amount of influence I have on these teenagers is minimal, obviously. Friends matter and know more, family influences more and even my fellow teachers end up influencing more. I don't want to be the only reference in their lives, but I often feel like I'm running into a wall, that the cruel reality around me and my students is so much more powerful than me. And also, theoretically I work for the state government, I have so much bureaucracy and responsibilities to fulfill that the little energy I have left is to do these things I said I do. And I kinda work for the government, so I feel very hypocritical, even though I know that I'm not, because I'm not a politician, a police officer or anything like that, I'm a teacher inserting myself in the public space, which is where I will have the most influence.

And finally, what bothers me most is when I realize that I am being practically forced to replicate professional behaviors in the classroom that, if I don't use, makes it impossible for me to teach a class. For example: in some classes in some schools, if I am not stricter or do not call the school's ""authorities"" such as the principal, I simply cannot teach due to the indisposition and lack of respect I suffer from the students. This lack of interest in education and lack of respect for education professionals in my country is so strong, teachers are devalued and underpaid. and are beaten in the streets by police. It's a culture of teacher hatred in right-wing media that preaches us as indoctrinators, among other crazy things that have created this view among most students' families that school is a place to spend time and have fun with friends, studying doesn't lead to nothing. Students then arrive at school with this mentality and I understand where it all comes from, but I have less than 1 hour with them a week how am I going to explain this to a 16 year old. There's no way, so I end up shouting, taking them out of the classroom, so I can make the most of the little time I have to teach those who aren't like that. And I feel terrible. I studied so many beautiful theories about education at university and I can easily say: most of them are rubbish, all from people who have never set foot in a classroom and taught by university professors who have never even set foot in a public school. Anyway, all of this leaves me confused, angry, feeling guilty and insufficient. And all because I am a public school teacher and also an anarchist.

Remster123,What made you a Socialist/How did you become class concious?,"Edit: Why do people object to me asking the same question to multiple subreddits? Is that bad? Im being totally genuine about that, happy to remove them if it is! I just wanted to hear from perspectives across the left on reddit, and I feel the question is more or less the same! I swear im asking in good faith!

What made you a Socialist/Communist/Anarchist? How did you become class concious?:

* Were these seperate things for you?
* Was it a single event or moment you can recall, or in your opinion more gradual?
* How would you define your politics beforehand if you are comfortable sharing, as in left/centre/right or broadly apolitical?
* How would you have ideologically described yourself?
* Were you already sympathetic to socialism/communism, or were you the opposite?
* How would you define yourself now (Anarchist, ML, Trostkyist, Cliffite, Libertarian socialist) and how did your experiences influence this?
* What organisation are you now in, if any? How did this relate to the above, if it all?

Feel free to answer just part of this, rather than all the questions above if you dont care for it.

Ive been thinking alot about how this occurs lately, thinking about if more theory could be developed on exactly how this occurs in people, on a social and psychological level.

Im also just very curious to hear about peoples experiences across the Left!

Edit to add my newest comment:

Since people seem to think im coming at this from some sort of ignorance rather than a difference of undertstanding, perspective, or opinion I thought id provide some articles explaining my point of view/perspective some what, as its understood where I organise. This isnt to say opposing views arrent valid, but that both are equally valid, and they are fine to be discussed as so!

Ensavil,Fascism is capitalism's lightning rod,"While researching different fascist movements, both past and present, I have noticed a peculiar set of similarities between them, beyond their defining palingenetic ultranationalism.

1. They gain popularity in the times of economic strife, utilising populist rhetoric to rally the masses around fascists' promises of economic revival and denouncements of ruling moderate politicians - Mussolini exploited the disillusionment and poverty of Italian WWI veterans, Hitler promised to rebuild German economy from the Great Depression and the Treaty of Versailles, Le Pen and Trump both built their support on the popular anger at the effects of neoliberal policies.
2. They are backed by the economic elite - eg. Hitler's campaign was funded by German industrialists, while Trump's was bankrolled by Elon Musk and shielded from criticism by Jeff Bezos.
3. They redirect the popular outrage at dire economic conditions away from the capitalist class, towards a scapegoat - for Hitler it was the Jews, the communists, the gays and the trans people, for Le Pen it is immigrants, for Trump it is the immigrants, the ""woke"" and the trans people.
4. Once in power, they quickly abandon the facade of pro-worker economic populism and readily serve the interests of the owner class - Mussolini banned strikes and non-fascist worker syndicates, Hitler privatised most industry, Trump assembled a cabinet of billionares and multi-millionares, two of which are now in charge of de-regulating their own industries.

These facts have led me to theorise that a key function of fascism is to act as a lightning rod to capitalism - when the latter creates infuriating poverty and inequality that could result in a mass anti-capitalist revolt, fascists sweep in, backed by the funds and propaganda provided by their elite sponsors, to redirect the popular outrage towards their chosen scapegoat and seize state institutions for themselves.

This ingenious symbiosis between capitalism and fascism is quadruply dire:

1. It preserves capitalism, with its exploitation and authoritarian working conditions, in spite of the popular rage instilled by its socio-economic consequences.
2. It bolsters capitalism moreso than typical liberalism does, by placing authoritarians indebted to their corporate sponsors (or said corporate sponsors themselves) in key regulatory positions within state bureaucracy.
3. It causes severe, often lethal systemic violence towards members of the scapegoat group.
4. It turns otherwise decent people into bigoted lunatics, through repeated exposure to conspiracy theories propagandised by corporate and, following a fascist takeover, state actors, for the benefit of both actors.

thegreatself,My idea for an 'Eat the Rich' ARG (Aternate Reality Game),"Time's are tough and reality is bleak, to put it mildly - and nothing’s going to get better, ever - we are stuck in a death-spiral into absurdity, accelerated by our own worst collective human traits.

So what options do working class people have to stave off the infinite existential horror of suffering in a post-truth capitalist-controlled hellscape ruled by the limitless potential of human corruption and greed, propped up by a framework that ultimately rewards those qualities?

Rot? Doomscroll? Endure the exploitation as something inevitable and natural? Etch words into your shell casings?

Mario's brother is on to something, but the potential power of an act is limited by the collective reaction - if any - to it. All “lone wolves” who commit similar acts of violence usually do so in the hope of being the spark to set off some broader movement, and there is never any real social change except through community.

I've been trying to brain-storm some ""collective spells"" we - as unwashed plebs - might try casting in an effort to change our shared material reality for the better. Memes we might conjure to inflict psychic damage on some “thing” that exists physically but without a body - like money.

How do you guillotine the head off of an idea?

If one person doing something is an issue, one hundred is a nuisance, ten thousand a concern, one hundred thousand a problem, and by one million+ we’re at a full-blown unrelenting and unstoppable force of nature.

So - the game?

It's very simple - we can all interact with it and watch as it changes on a daily basis. The very existence of 'the game' might immediately effect its rankings and narrative, and any person that wants to, can interact with it however they’d like.

A website with two lists on each side of the page - on the left is a list of the wealthiest individuals in Canada - you do not need anything more than a name and a net worth in billions - see [Wikipedia's article on List of Canadians by net worth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Canadians_by_net_worth).

On the right hand side of the page, there's a second list of causes of death - any billionaire that died would have an equal number of points assigned for each dollar equivalent to their net worth when they got entropied - so, for example, since [James K. Irving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_K._Irving) [recently passed at 96, peacefully in his sleep](https://www.ctvnews.ca/business/billionaire-businessman-james-k-irving-dead-at-96-1.6936770), we'll assign about 5.5 billion ""points"" to ""Natural causes"", which is likely to be our All Time Top Scorer.

If we wanted to go retroactive and include Barry Sherman, we’d assign about 3 billion points to the ['Murdered - Unsolved'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Sherman#Death) category - probably not going to find its way to the top 5, an outlier for sure.

Now, anybody can join in when and as they see fit - if they felt a moral obligation or were just looking for something fun to do on a Sunday, for example.

Nothing left to live for? 

Maybe for the Highest Score of All Time?

Each country could have its own National Leaderboard with a separate list for the International League which is when things would really get interesting - everybody in the world can play together!

Since the “points” assigned a category for a wealthy individual’s expiry are completely made up, meaningless, and without any actual value (outside of whatever social value certain groups might apply) it can’t really be argued that the game, website, or list itself is inciting violence or soliciting murder - it’s simply a set of lists - how the greater public decides to react, engage, and participate with the list(s) is what determines how the game ultimately plays out - and how an alternate reality might merge with the one we inhabit now.

Actually eating a billionaire will net an additional 10,000,000,000 points - because why not?

newnewengland,"Opportunity: Stop using the old ""left-right"" paradigm to reach people and form a new coalition of anti-authoritarianism","EDIT: just pointing out that this is perhaps a bit US-centric. Sorry for not specifying earlier. I suppose I'm a victim of the same US-centered thinking I loathe :-)



Hi everyone! A confluence of recent events, both at the national level, as well as within my own little city have led me to believe that people are more receptive than at any time in my life to the ideas of the ""left"" (socialism, communism, anarchism, etc.)

I'm 38, so I remember following No WTO protests through punk bands that were vocal about it, the 'war on terror', Occupy, DAPL, BLM, the 2016 race where Bernie seemed credible as a national candidate, Trump, and I'm probably forgetting other formative events).

I grew up working class with parents who voted both Democrat and Republican. They always seemed to have a heavy dose of cynicism and skepticism toward politics and mainly voted exclusively in presidential elections. But I remember saying to my dad once, when I was 8 or 9, something like ""you vote Democrat because Republicans are for rich people and Democrats are for poor people, and we're poor"". I still remember his response: ""No, they are both for rich people"".

Over the years, culture wars and disinformation led my parents to become Trump voters, and here is my main 'thesis': I believe that the *some* of the same energy that exists among Trump voters could be tapped into by those of us with more fair-minded, egalitarian points of view.

For instance, my city has a problem with our police force being violent and unchecked, with the worst of their crimes being exploitation of sex workers. I had a conversation with my mom about it, mentioning I'd gone to our city council to complain about it, and she told me that back when she was a kid, women knew not to go into certain towns alone, for fear of sexual violence from predatory cops. This really made me feel like there could be some common ground regarding distrust of authority and breaking destructive power structures.

Seeing so many people vote Trump at the same time that Luigi Mangione became a folk hero (I am into anarchy &amp; **peace**, btw) made me realize that there is a massive amount of people that are dissatisfied with the status quo. While I obviously loathe Trump, and believe he has hurt and will hurt many people, perhaps for decades to come, I believe that he reflects a mirror back on the worst parts of American life. He should annex Canada and Greenland, if only to make it clear to the world that yes, the western world is basically ruled by the USA, the nefarious hegemon, due to our excessive military spending as well as our highly consumerist culture that makes us the trough-slurping pigs of the world, while allowing an underclass within our own borders to suffer under the covers.

I believe that if we keep preaching things like distrust of authority, breaking sick power structures, and try to move away from all these tired left-right, Democrat-Republican, false dichotomies, we may be able to reach some allies among Trump voters and people that identify as right-wing or conservative.

**TL;DR: Shared distrust of authority, coupled with a growing awareness of systemic failures, presents an opportunity. By focusing on dismantling oppressive structures and challenging the tired left-right paradigm, we can build bridges with those who, despite their support for Trump, yearn for a more just and equitable society, by engaging in honest, empathetic dialogue that centers on shared values and a collective vision for a better future.**",178,0.86,111,1736431257,Anarchism

GeorgeGervinTheGOAT,Critique of Mutual Aid,"Hi all,

I've been part of a mutual aid group for the past couple years that is explicitly anarchist, abolitionist, and non-hierarchical. Our main project is cooking fresh, nutritious meals for unsheltered folks each week, and we also have a propane program where folks can get free propane to stay warm/cook. We also distribute harm reduction, clothes, etc. 

I've recently been exposed to critiques of the mutual aid project from the socialist/Marxist point of view. I know one common critique is that much of what is packaged as mutual aid often isn't very mutual, which I think is a valid point-my group is always brainstorming ways to be more truly mutual, such as giving opportunities to the our unsheltered neighbors to come help cook and distribute meals (to the extent that they want to, not as an obligation). That being said, I think even when mutual aid is fairly one-sided, the distinction between how a horizontally-organized, no-strings attached project operates and a neoliberal charity or church is significant enough that I don't have a huge problem with the phrase ""mutual aid.""

The critique that has given me more food for thought is over strategy. The arguments I've seen say that mutual aid is essentially just a band-aid that doesn't address root issues, which frankly I think is a pretty uncontroversial thing to say that no one I know in the MA world would disagree with. Where I understand the point is that maintaining a well-functioning mutual aid group is incredibly time intensive, and in theory that time could be spent helping politically organize in a way that would more directly grasp for the levers of power that could ultimately redistribute wealth in a way that would benefit far more people far more greatly than cooking meals every week ever could. 

I have access to wealth and have donated a lot of money to more root-cause political projects, but realistically I work full time and contribute what free time I can to MA because I like being involved in my neighbors and because it helps people in the here and now. Part of this is admittedly a bit selfish: I get more satisfaction from MA than I have from helping with political projects, which is important for my mental health as an individual in our capitalist society. I also love being part of a community that takes care of each other, though I've heard socialists critique the focus on community over the focus on a society and the idea that MA groups are little islands of solidarity whereas the Marxist project is to unite the working class across the country and world towards a common cause. One thing I feel is missing from this aspect of the Marxist critique is that in my experience, lots of trans folks are attracted to mutual aid (I'm a cis-male, for what it's worth), and I think part of the reason it speaks more to them is that our ""society"" is largely very hostile to them, and while I'm all about class solidarity, this a reality for a lot of marginalized people that I don't often see addressed from the Marxist lens.

Anyways, this is kind of a jumble of thoughts, but just wanted to see what people who are more anarchist-inclined like myself think about these critiques of MA. Would our time be better spent on political projects that have the possibility of achieving a greater good, and if so, what would that practically even look like?",118,0.98,83,1736361228,Anarchism

•Bodily autonomy (The right to choose abortion. The right to medical contraceptives such as IUDs. The right to change your gender through legal and medical means.)

•The taxation of the rich

•Universal health care

•Forcing companies to acknowledge their affect on global warming and do what they can to limit it, pollution, and other harmful practices even at a cost to revenue and shareholder value

•Ending lobbying in America and dismantling the “first past the pole” voting technique in favor of the approval rating system

•Defunding the police to any extent/ enforcing much stricter training policies

yungsxccubus,operation olive branch warning,"hello friends

i wanted to make this post because we get a lot of Palestinians (or scam artists pretending to be them) in here posting donation links. in a previous thread i linked to UNRWA and operation olive branch as official sources to donate to. 

it has now come to my attention that operation olive branch are reporting their former volunteers to the FBI. these former volunteers had their own issues with OOB, but left peacefully and to my knowledge didn’t try to cause them any issues. OOB have used their lawyer to tell these activists that they have been reported to the FBI and are now under investigation. 

i think this is absolutely sickening but not surprising, and this is enough for me to no longer consider OOB as a legitimate humanitarian effort. it’s quite clear that they have chosen to weaponise a system of corruption and oppression against activists they don’t like and given how aggressively cops and FBI are cracking down on pro-palestinian protestors, it’s a deliberate attempt to get them taken care of permanently. it’s likely that many of these activists are people of colour, which makes the weaponisation of these systems that much more insidious. 

if you want to donate to Palestine, ~~please donate through UNRWA~~ (not trying to convince anyone to donate), they have an interactive map feature to track the aid going in. operation olive branch do have a master list and i think that could potentially still be a good resource, but i would not get involved in any tangible way with them anymore. stay safe :)

AustmosisJones,You can't plan an anarchist society.,"People always seem to focus on the granular details of how an anarchistic world would work. ""How do you prevent rape?"" ""How do you defend your civilization from outside interference?"" and so forth.

The answer is that we won't know until we try. Not really. We can theorize all day, but it kind of defeats the whole purpose of anarchism. I don't like to speak for others, so I'll just say that I believe people can govern themselves, and that means letting them figure out how to do it best, provided that if anyone tries to exploit anyone else, we all gang up on them and put a stop to it.

The thing I love most about anarchism is its elegant simplicity. Hierarchy=bad. That's it. The rest will work itself out. The only reason things haven't already worked themselves out is that we live in a hierarchical society.

Seriously, everything I've ever read on the subject seems to just boil down to very smart people trying to convince everyone else that it really is that simple. Which it is.

So stop trying to plan it out so carefully. Accept that it's a flexible system by design, and that any question which crops up over the course of it's implementation will find an answer that suits the moment, and might change later.

justgotone1question,On happiness,"We are told happiness is something internal, that depends solely on ourselves, on our ""attitude"", on how we think, that it is a mental state, independent of reality, and this point is driven into us by innumerable examples of martyrs, of stoics and ascetics of whom it is said achieved a supreme degree of happiness, ""nirvana"", in spite of (or even thanks to) the extreme deprivations and earthly pains they endured.

This I hold to be false. Happiness is a product of our quality of life. That's why Danes are happier than Greeks. Danes are asked: ""what is the secret of happiness?"", but they never give the right answer: purchasing power. Material comfort, but only if it is generalized in society, because the perception of poverty causes sorrow even in the souls of the rich. That's why rich South-Africans, Hispanics, and Chinese can't have peace and live in fear, and flee their countries to live in Copenhagen and Zurich.

We are told the opposite so we look within ourselves for what is to blame for our misery, so we do not attempt to change our circumstances but rather live and die doubly miserable, tortured not only by want but also by an unfounded guilt, as unhappiness is seen as a failure, a character flaw, and not as a symptom of living in a bleak and diseased World; so that we do not understand that, in order to be happy, we must make our societies more like Danish and Norweigian societies.

And that means revolution. It means dispossessing the rich from the means of production they have hoarded and distribute them among the workers. It means toppling the old institutions and authorities and establishing new ones that ensure true democracy, popular sovereignty and, therefore, equality and generalized wellbeing.

BradCowDisease,Need advice about whether to landlord,"I'm hoping that some people in this community can help me with a moral dilemma.

A few years ago my wife and I bought a two family house. We'd been renting and it was a good deal because one side was absolutely unlivable. My in-laws kind of pressured us into the purchase because my FIL has been gutting and fixing houses (and landlording) for decades. We lived in one side while renovating the other.

Fast forward to today. We've finally moved in to the new side of the house, and now my in-laws want us to rent out the other side as an income property. I really don't want to do this for a couple of reasons. I hate landlords and the entire concept of doing it. My FIL has had to evict many tenants from his own rental properties throughout the years, and I just don't think I could do that. The entire concept of owning anything to rent it out just fundamentally conflicts with what I think the world should look like (Spoiler alert: I'm an anarchist as well).

So how will he react if there is a nation-wide flag burning festival?
(Flag desecration is not illegal in the United States because it is protected by the First Amendment as a form of symbolic speech.)

Crimethinc has been calling for Festivals of Resistance https://www.reddit.com/r/CrimethInc/s/oO1vqxqZOB on the weekend of January 18th.  I think Trump would really get his panties in a bunch if his sacred symbol is destroyed in his name as a sign of resistance, wouldn’t he?

Or if burning doesn’t work for you, perhaps we fly the flags out of our cars and pickup trucks the way the false-patriots do except ours are caught in the doors or trunk lids and dragging on the pavement instead. 

Or if we want to be a disruption on inauguration day, would traffic grind to a halt if a few of Trump’s magnificent American flags were lying vulnerable in a Washington DC intersection or tumbling like tumbleweeds down the middle of the Capital Beltway?

And finally as a way to raise money for a good cause, perhaps we could start a Flag Burning Challenge along the same lines as the popular Ice Bucket Challenge of 2014.  If so, what cause would be appropriate?

Just wondering everyone’s thoughts on this. ",1,0.67,3,1736014034,Anarchism
AF2C,The AF2C is 1 year old : Join Us in Building a Better Future !,"**Propagandists, Logisticians, Hackers, Lawyers, Social media wizards, Graphists, and everyone that makes the world go round — we need YOU !**
**Happy New Year!** Over the past year, the AF2C (Anarchist Federation of Cyber-Communes) has grown into a small but vibrant hub of mutual aid, creativity, and action. Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve accomplished so far :
- Received the [Jen Angel Grant](https://anarchistagency.com/jen-angel-anarchist-media-grant/).
- Launched _Mutual Audio_, an anarchist podcast distro (3 episodes and counting).
- Built a new website to expand our services.
- One of our member created [zines](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17OZgbQ3OJjNmROhWv71TxnW8Hv5km7bO/view?usp=sharing)
- Began federating communes, like **Well4Ward**, a co-op housing initiative and **Just Wondering**
- Developed [data vizualisations](https://af2c.org/Palestine/) to help us grapple with the ongoing genocide in Palestine.
But we need _your_ help to keep growing !
### **Current Communes : Join the Action**
Here are some of our communes and words from them :
#### Well4Ward
Are you watching the world go from bad to worse and feeling powerless to do anything?
WE NEED YOUR HELP TO FIND A WAY FORWARD
Well4Ward is a housing reform initiative focused on raising funds and providing start up and ongoing support for a new model of co-operative housing. The goal is to get people and communities direct ownership of their homes, and help them set up what they need to maintain it. These distrubuted and interconnected co-operatives form the foundation for community investment and rebuilding a human centered society. But to get this launched, we need some help covering the legal and start up costs. We've set a goal of $3000, this will cover the cost of a lawyer who specializes in the types of bylaws we will need to protect the integrity of our new start up and set us up for successful growth. If we raise more than that, it will go to the costs of developing online infrastructure to support this initiative - a fully featured website and community network. Think of this as an investment in social change, and let yourself dream that it's possible things could get better again if we work together.
Join the conversation !
#### [Just Wondering...](https://justwondering.io/)
In 2024 we worked on two long-form animated essays which both required quite a bit of research! The first one, “Escape, Resistance and Solidarity - Farmed Animal Sanctuaries as the Heart of the Movement” is an exploration of the solidarity we can extend to (exploited/farmed) non-human animals through the sanctuary movement and beyond it. The second, “Natural Gas, The Bridge To Climate Disaster” narrates the lies the fossil fuel industry has been telling us for decades to keep us hooked on what they’re selling; it’s also a dedication to climate activists everywhere. Before working on these two, we created three video-poems in solidarity with Palestine which were screened at a few fundraisers. We also held a speculative workshop imagining multispecies education, got the 2024 Jen Angel Anarchist Media Grant, made new stickers and a zine based on one of our animated essays! For 2025 we have another two long-form animated essays already planned - this time, they are both somewhat related to animal politics and animal liberation, from different angles. And we hope we’ll be able to make some more video-poems for Palestine as well and continue working on the drafts we started sometime ago! Every year we have bigger expectations than what we actually manage to do, but this is what keeps us going.
#### Anarchist Wiki
About half a year ago I started the AnarWiki project ago to preserve a previous attempt at an Anarchist Wiki which was taken off the web (just after being vandalised by Tankies). Subsequently I added some articles from other sources, and made the mistake of trying to import some from Wikipedia (wasted too much time try to fix templates for too little benefit). I’ve been a little sad that there haven’t been other volunteers, but also haven’t made many people aware of it, as I didn’t feel it was quite good enough to launch yet. I’ve also been distracted with pro-Anarchist blog posts and my ‘Reasons To Hate Capitalism’ series (video version coming soon), which have been more popular than I’ve expected. See this substack In the new year I expect to spend more time on the Wiki, as I believe it could be an important resource, and hope to help get it to a place that others want to be involved, as I feel its also important to be a shared responsibility.
#### Graphic commune (Samikata)
I've joined AF2C mid spring and shortly began to collaborate in the propaganda &amp; graphics communes, as well as Well4Ward not too long afterwards. Through the few months here I've created multiple posters including full fledged artworks, which, while outside my comfort zone, definitely helped me to work on my art skills and try different approaches to design. The animation for Well4ward in particular has had a major impact on my capabilities and I feel like it has improved my stroke confidence by a mile. Overall I'm glad I'm here and I hope to be able to contribute more in the coming months. I've met quite a few kind comrades here and hopefully will meet many more in the future.

crab_boy_1,Blockchain resource allocation for big projects?,"I think there's a recent tendency to be just techno-pessimistic these days all over, because all the benefits naturally benefit state and capital under this system.

I am new to anarchism, but I was thinking about how you could allocate scarce and valuable resources to important, societal projects. Listening to David Graeber's convo with Peter Thiel about the future (this is one of the most interesting conversations I've ever heard [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eF0cz9OmCGw&amp;ab\_channel=GraeberWave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eF0cz9OmCGw&amp;ab_channel=GraeberWave) ) was really inspiring to the notion that Anarchism could scale very well, and actually be used to create technology in a more efficient way than capital accumulation. 

Like in a global anarchist scenario what if you used blockchain technologies to give people 5 (example number) monthly ""votes"" toward resource devotion for big projects -- say a goal, eg solving climate change or going to mars. That would become a percentage of available resources.

Am I just reinventing money here? Or a Plebiscite? Please recommend any literature on anarcho futurism. In some ways they seem incompatible (certainly technology would look different) but I also could just as easily imagine the ways in which it could be useful to create, maintain and upgrade such a society.

[deleted],Reasons for lack of libertarian socialism in South Korea ,"As I explained [before](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/1hr4vn1/south_korean_yoon_seokyeol_regime_has_tried_to/), libertarian socialist movements in South Korea are in terrible status. Let me explain more.

**Mccarthism and fear of North Korean fifth column**

Since 1953, South Korea has been under threat of North Korean attack. And since North Korea is a state capitalist (in other words, state wage slavery) state, Mccarthism is common in South Korea. Korean militarist tyrants, such as [Pak Chŏng-Hŭi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_Chung_Hee), [Chŏn Tu-Hwan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chun_Doo-hwan) and [No T'ae-U](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roh_Tae-woo), have brainwashed Koreans that **SOCIALISM = COMMUNISM = ML = STALINISM = NORTH KOREA = DICTATORSHIP = TOTALITARIANISM**. Even the concepts of Nordic Model or social democracy are shunned here. (I hate those ideas too. No matter how generous your tyrant is, you are still a slave.)

**Normalization of control**

Due to long-term dictatorship here, control of state and police is normal here. Guns are nearly 100% forbidden, and worker strike or demonstration is often accused of ""NK and Chinese agents that try to spread chaos in society"". If you bring the ideas of squatting or illegalism here, well... good luck.

**Social Darwinism**

Our social studies textbooks teach us that capitalism lets you earn what you deserve, based on your talents and efforts. If you search on slum and the homeless on Internet, they are like, ""Well, you should have studied hard in your youth"" or ""So what? You want to steal our private property for your welfare?"". Such ideas were especially promoted during military dictatorship period, when South Korea had to exploit her people as hard as possible in order to be a developed country. 

**Hostility on femenism and idpol**

To satisfy our complaints on social injustice, [liberals](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(South_Korea,_2015)) have made some lipservices - there are [Ministry of Gender Equality and Family](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Gender_Equality_and_Family) and many feminist organizations. However, most of them are TERF and selective feminists. When they illegalized the pornography while advocating male only military conscription, many people started believing that feminism = female supremarcy. Not only feminism but also whole liberal idpol is despised by many young (20-39) men, and [centrist conservatives](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Reform_Party_(South_Korea)) got much popularity via anti-feminism.

**Sabotage of ML**

Many leftist areas, such as parties, NGOs and labor unions are overrun by MLs such as [Progressive Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Party_(South_Korea,_2017)) so libertarian socialists have little place here.

**Christian fundamentalism**

Although I am a born Protestant (Presbyterian) Christian and attend to Church every week, I should admit that Christian fundamentalism is severe here. Due to influence of American evangelicalism, many Christian organizations here - notably Esther Prayer Movement (에스더기도운동본부) and InterCP(인터콥) - are based on fundamental ideas. You can see Korean flag, American flag, Israeli flag and cross together in many South Korean far-right marches and demonstration. While Christian rate is roughly 25% in South Korea, fundamentalist ideas such as Homophobia, Islamophobia and patriarchy are widely spread. Can you believe that there is only one church (섬돌향린교회, Sumdol Presbyterian Church) that openly welcomes LGBTs, and it is designated as a heretic church by roughly half of South Korean Protestant churches?

Despite these adversities and hardships, I am convinced that we - not only South Koreans but also our compatriots in North Korea - will, with the help from companions in Japan, China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Mongolia, Vietnam, Thailand, Myanmar, Indonesia, the Philippines, etc., create humanity's happiness for ourselves and all. In 1198, [Man Jŏk](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manjeok) fought right in this land against class system, and in 1812, [Hong Kyŏng-Rae](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Gyeong-rae) rose up here against feudalist exploitation. We are descendants of Man Jŏk, Hong Kyŏng-Rae, [Kim Chwa-Chin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Chwa-chin), and [Yi Hoe-Yŏng](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Hoe-yeong), and **we will let the people command and the government obey!**",55,0.94,4,1735982233,Anarchism

karlbenedict12,"some observations regarding how anarchism has been treated (in my country, at least)","it's very interesting to note how drastically different the treatment of anarchists and anarchist-adjacent libertarian socialists is by anti-socialist/pro-capitalist propaganda. 

since the overwhelming majority of historical and contemporary anarchist/libertarian socialist movements, revolutions, and rebellions (the paris commune in france, revolutionary catalonia in spain, and makhnovshchina in ukraine; the zapatistas in mexico and rojava in syria, respectively) have shown the possibility of socialism working in practice but not ticking the boxes of the usual often-exaggerated ""critiques"" of state socialism (authoritarianism, famines, human right abuses, and mass murders), anti-socialist propaganda towards anarchism/libertarian socialism takes the form of erasure. instead of the usual ""propaganda of commission"" whereas positive claims are accused (the soviet union *is* bad, and so on), it has manifested as a sort of ""propaganda of omission"". ""forget anarchism exists"", ""there were no historical anarchist movements"", and so on. this paves the way for easy, simplistic, and uncritical critiques of anarchism so that those who, if ever, encounters it will just easily dismiss it as a fringe impractical ideology with no real-life applications, and also, divorced from the rest of the socialist movement—meaning the rest of the labor movement—hence, the everyday worker.

at least here in the philippines, that is.

veganarchistxxx,"The City of Elgin, Illinois Just Declared War on All Houseless Folks Living There. Noise Demo/Rally Saturday Jan 4th at 1pm","THE CITY OF ELGIN HAS 
DECLARED WAR 
AGAINST ALL UNHOUSED PEOPLE
IT’S TIME TO FIGHT BACK!.

On the night of December 19th, 2024, in a city hall courtroom of only a handful of people, Elgin city council members approved and celebrated a plan to eliminate “Tent City”, along with all other tents and self-made structures that act as shelter made by those living on the streets. This plan was discussed and decided on without the knowledge or presence of the hundreds of houseless people living in Elgin.

“Tent City”, located on roughly 8 acres between the Fox River and Route 31 in Elgin, has been a site used for encampments by people experiencing houselessness ever since the demolition of a metal fabrication factory there back in 1990. For many of these residents, this is the only space in the city that offers safety and accommodations that allow them autonomy over their lives. With this autonomy, the residents of Tent City have spent time and energy over the years building and sustaining this community. 

The City of Elgin plans to evict all residents of Tent City, along with the hundreds of other houseless individuals residing in tents and self-made structures around the city of Elgin, moving only 50 of them to the Lexington Inn &amp; Suites for a duration of four months. This hotel is widely known for bed bug and cockroach infestations, along with sanitary conditions that only barely meet city code.

There is currently no plan for housing after the four months has ended. 
“We know this is a temporary solution,” Assistant City Manager Karina Nava said. 

ALL houseless individuals, including those selected for the four-month stay at the hotel, are ordered to immediately vacate the premises of their encampment or face trespassing charges. After every resident is evicted from “Tent City” in particular, the “site will be secured” and “cleared and remediated”. Furthermore, the city promises to instate a ‘zero tolerance policy’ for any future tents and self-made shelters, leaving those who are unable to access options provided by the city at extreme risk to the impending winter temperatures presently and long-term.

Rather than meeting houseless people where they are, where they feel safe, and investing in resources that could help them re-build after two recent fires, the City of Elgin would rather spend more money and resources by evicting them all, subjecting them to the trauma of forced displacement. Parks Superintendent Greg Hulke estimated the cost of the eviction and clearing to be between $2 million and $2.5 million, with the process taking two to four months, not including the cost of the relocation of the selected 50 residents.

While “safety” has been said to be the reason for all of this, it is abundantly clear that the real motive is the same beautification process seen happening in many other gentrified cities. What this eviction plan fails to reveal is an anti-homelessness motive integrated into the city’s vision of boosting property value. 
.
Elgin Police Chief Ana Lalley said the department will begin the process on or about Jan. 20.  
The unhoused people of Elgin deserve the autonomy to determine their own living situations.
This plan is not a rescue – it is an eviction, and for many people, it may be a death sentence.

[deleted],South Korean Yoon Seok-Yeol regime has tried to remove the legacy of the anarchist anti-colonial movement,"sources and related articles: [Korean anarchist movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_People%27s_Association_in_Manchuria), [South Korean New Right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Right_(South_Korea)), and [Hong Beom-Do](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Beom-do)

I'm a teenage student in South Korea. (And that's why my English is awkward) Though I am not an anarchist, but a libertarian socialist like Bookchin and Ocalan, [recent events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_South_Korean_martial_law_crisis) brought me here to write a really, really long article about how our government has tried to erase anarchist anti-Japanese resistances from 1910 to 1945.

As you know, Korean anarchists fought bravely when Japanese imperialists occupied Korea. [Kim Chwa-Chin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Chwa-chin) and his crews made an autonomous zone in Korean diaspora in Manchuria, and there was even a small [secret guerilla army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroic_Corps).

After the independence, all the South Korean politicians - [left-wing nationalists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Party_(South_Korea,_2017)), [centrist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(South_Korea,_2015)) [liberals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebuilding_Korea_Party), [centrist conservatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Reform_Party_(South_Korea)) and [hard-line conservatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_Power_Party_(South_Korea)) have acknowledged anarchist roles in Korean independence. Just... just recall how Ukrainian far-rights try to downplay Makhnovshchina as if it was just a Ukrainian anti-Russian nationalist organization. The same thing has happened in South Korea for 70 years, especially because South Korea had to ""prove"" to Korean Diasporas ( [Chaoxianzu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Chinese), [Zainichi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koreans_in_Japan), etc ) that South Korea is legitimate Korea, and North Korea has to do nothing with Korean independence activities.

However, things have changed when Yoon Seok-Yeol, a supporter of [New-Right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Right_(South_Korea)), came to power. As you see in the article, [New-Rights ](https://namu.wiki/w/%EB%89%B4%EB%9D%BC%EC%9D%B4%ED%8A%B8(%EB%8C%80%ED%95%9C%EB%AF%BC%EA%B5%AD))believe that [Korea before the occupation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Empire) was a feudal state that deserved to collapse, and that Japanese Empire came to Korea to ""modernize"" and ""industrialize"" Korea. (Just like how Chinese propaganda says about Tibet) They believe that Korean independence activists were ""terrorists"", and that their modern counterpart is North Korea. They say that they are ""anti-nationalists that fight against chauvinists"", but they uphold Japanese nationalism.

So, with fascists like this, Yoon Seok-Yeol tried to denounce Korean anarchism and its legacy. [They tried to remove the busts of various independence activists, including Kim Chwa-Chin, from Korea Military Academy](https://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/english_editorials/1106781.html). They said that they were alleged of collaborating with ""commies"", despite **Kim Chwa-Chin having been assassinated by an ML!** Even[ Lee Hoe-Yeong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Hoe-yeong), another anarchist, was considered a ""commie"".

Other three  independence activists - who were not anarchists - were accused of ""being communists"" as well. However, [Chi Chongchon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi_Ch%27%C5%8Fngch%27%C5%8Fn) and[ Lee Beom-Seok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Beom-seok_(prime_minister)) were right-wing nationalists, and [Hong Beom-D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Beom-do)o, while participating in USSR communist party, never upholded ML for a single time. Also, Hong Beom-Do died before North Korea was established, so he has nothing with North Korea. **But all of five were accused of ""reds"".**

In contrast, South Korean dictator [Park Chung-Hee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_Chung_Hee), the greatest idol of South Korean conservatives and New-rights, participated in [Worker's Party of South Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workers%27_Party_of_South_Korea) in late 1940s. This shows how contradictory they are.

Not only that, but also look at [this](https://imnews.imbc.com/news/2024/politics/article/6627667_36431.html). (Written in Korean)

윤희석 (Yoon Hui-Seok, conservative): 예를 들어 홍범도 장군은 고려공산당 입당, 지난번에 흉상 관련해서 그 얘기를 했잖아요. 우리 군이 자유민주주의 체제에서 그에 적대세력과 싸워야 하는 사명을 갖고 있는 상황에서 ( For example, general Hong Beom-Do, as I told you before when the ""bust"" controversy surged, participated in Korean Communist Party. As our army has to fight under liberal democracy system, against the system's enemies)

김좌진 장군도, 자꾸 얘기가 가는데, 당시에 독립운동하던 북간도 위주의 위에 봤을 때는, 우리의 주변 국가들이 사회주의, 공산주의의 본령이기 때문에 어쩔 수 없이 그쪽하고 연결이 됐을 거예요. ( And also, when it comes to general Kim Chwa-Chin, he was active in Northern[ Jiandao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiandao) \- since near Northern Jiandao were socialist, communist countries, Kim Chaw-Chin must have been related to such forces too. )

In this routine, New-rights are continuously trying to remove anarchist struggles in Korean independence movement.

TL;DR

1. Our government has caught schizophrenia: it believes in some brainwashing **like SOCIALISM = COMMUNISM = ML(M) = NORTH KOREA = DICTATORSHIP = TOTALITARIANISM and MILITARISM = ANTI-COMMUNISM = LIBERAL DEMOCRACY.**
2. Therefore, our government is a strong supporter of Mccarthysm.
3. And that's why our government has tried to remove anarchist legacies of Korean independence activism, and made a self-coup last month.

We all know how problematic the world of academia can be. However, as a stereotypical bookworm, I still enjoy diving deep into dense, theoretical works. Recently, I came across something very interesting in the realm of cultural studies and communication, which was meant to be shared.
The following lectures aren't specifically about anarchy, but I believe they offer valuable insights into contexts that are deeply relevant to anarchists, regardless of the specific adjectives we might use to describe ourselves.
They explore topics such as anti-consumption, representation, racism, mass incarceration, the military-industrial complex, abuse, interpersonal violence, patriarchy, misogyny, and other important issues within gender studies.

If you know any other freely available and well-structured lecture series (preferably more than just one-off, hour-long recordings, but rather seminar series or full university courses with syllabi attached) please share them in the comments. I’d LOVE to create a kind of “Anarchist Open Courseware.”
Thank you in advance! I hope you find these resources as useful and thought-provoking as I did.

DrPappa,What does effective anarchist propaganda look like in today's world?,"When people ask what they can do to contribute practically as anarchists, the usual answers seem to be, join or start a local mutual aid network, or look for your local Food Not Bombs group. 

Historically (here I'm thinking 1860s to the late 1930s), anarchist practice had two main strands:

- building support networks that could replace existing hierarchies 
- education, agitation and propaganda 

Both libertarian and state socialists were using education, agitation and propaganda in the decades leading up to and after WWI. In practice, this involved organising talks and debates at social clubs, village halls or union meetings, talking at public speaking pitches, putting up posters and distributing socialist newspapers and socialist literature. 

The environment these activists were working in was completely different to the modern world. With no TV or internet, people voluntarily went out to hear activists speak, just because it was something interesting to do. In some places, public speaking pitches were almost competitive arenas, with speakers vying for the largest crowd. Everything was new and people were often fighting for basic rights. People weren't yet jaded by the failure of unions or socialist parties to deliver on their promises.

Nowadays, we have an almost unlimited worldwide audience for propaganda and education, but it is easily eclipsed by all the other noise. Films, TV, internet, and the ever present advertising of consumer goods. In most developed countries, people aren't fighting for basic working rights or a basic standard of living. The nuclear family and home entertainment have drastically reduced the amount of time people socialise in public or communal spaces.

Modern anarchist propaganda often seems to take the form of ""subvertising"" or similar stunts that subvert the language and tools of consumerism. To me, this seems to be preaching to the converted, and not effective at conveying a message to ordinary working people. 

Are the approaches to education, agitation and propaganda that were effective 100 years ago relevant today? If not, what is?",38,0.95,13,1735471080,Anarchism

After all Tort didn't even shoot anyone and yet if people were calling them a terrorist orally some people were. 

But you shoot one CEO and now girls want to write a bunch of fan fiction about you. I'm not saying that's what should have happened with Tort. I'm just saying it just feels weirdly unfair it's hard to express exactly why.

I am working on a passion project for myself, a superhero based comic with my own characters and such. One of the main characters is punk, and while I am not punk myself, I want to go the long way to really get an accurate representation of punk culture and beliefs with this character.

I will do my own research, but I thought it wouldn't hurt to get a community opinion. How would your average punk feel about a superhero? Opinions, genuine critiques, etc. Would some of the things a superhero typically would do go against some of a punks standpoints or beliefs? Or would your average superhero doings instead side WITH their standpoints and beliefs? If you're punk/anarchist yourself, and somehow superheroes existed, what would your genuine opinion and critiques be relating to them?

If you need a better example than just ""your average superhero"" in case personal beliefs of said hero play into things, think of Batman and run with that. Thank you guys!",1,1,3,1735434118,Anarchism

FancyPerspective5693,Disability and Revolution.,"
I saw a post on another subreddit stating that change will only come to the US through violent revolution. While I don't want to tone police and I do understand the impulse behind violent revolution, I also want to share my perspective.

I have been diagnosed with dyspraxia, I seriously doubt that I would have any ability to aid any sort of violent revolution. More worryingly, I am concerned that any sort of violent revolution would only further the erasure of folks with disabilities like myself (people without the capacity to defend themselves from violence).

I get that people are inspired by the Luigi situation and deflated by the election, and that feeling is completely and totally valid. I just worry about folks with disabilities like myself being at best forgotten and at worst slaughtered in any sort of violent revolution.  I'd also like to keep overt ableism out of leftist spaces if at all humanly possible. 

TL DR, can we keep in mind how our ideas of revolution may reflect cultural ideas regarding ableism?

I’m from a large but isolated town in the midwest. There are a couple of college towns 30+ minutes in away as well as a small city that’s a bit further, but there are almost no leftist groups outside of these locations. The city really only has Food Not Bombs and the DSA, and the colleges have some abandoned book clubs on FaceBook and probably some student orgs but I’m not a student. 

I want to start something in my area because there’s no way I’m the only leftist in a 50 mile radius, but what will grab the most eyes and retain the most members? A reading club? Mutual aid group? I’m signed up to help out at my local food pantry so there’d be no use setting up something similar to that.

ComprehensiveCrab50,"Power as Cancer, it's not about states","I see many posts of people talking about anarchism as a place you can reach. But I think it's much more as a state of being. Because power is like cancer, it can corrupt a society coming from anywhere. It can be through charisma, brute force, personal connections. It can be trying to maintain an organization or position long after it's socially useful. The corruption of institutions. It's always there, there's no point where it's permanently defeated. 

But we evolved psychological immune responses to it, so we root for the underdog, distrust the powerful, ... and I believe being an anarchist is being very deliberate about it, strategizing, and collaborating to fight power without the aim of taking it for yourself. But it also needs creative aims, positive goals, so it's worth fight for and doesn't devolve into pure reactionary violence.

And it's important to have a sense of priority. Different groups are always vying for power, and a risk for the anarchist is going against the already weaker group, helping the stronger one just take over. When the spanish come to your land, it's probably not the best time to riot against tribal leaders or stop making weapons.

Right now, we have the richest men in the world, the president of the most powerful country, most big names in ""decentralized finance"" in a small connected clique. 

""*The ability to move money fluidly* and the erosion of the nation-state are closely related"", Peter Thiel said, as he joined with Elon Musk to try and allow everyone to move money fluidly.   
""We will coup whoever we want! Deal with it."" - Elon Musk, in a discussion about lithium mining in Bolivia

In Europe, one of, maybe the most bureaucratic organization ever conceived is leading the fight against big tech, investing billions to provide free, open alternatives in hardware and software that can help guarantee our freedoms. These are strange times. It may well be that the end of the state, at this moment, would be the worst thing to ever happen to anarchism.

With enough technological superiority, the rules of the WTO on IP, we may end up in a stable de facto world government, and because the violence is outsourced to the state/local elites/PMCs and the information is filtered by big tech, we don't even see how it went wrong or who to fight. If we even have the means to do so. Other than MAYBE China or the EU, I think no one can pose challenges without a coup, corruption charges, a forex crisis, the opposition suddenly swimming in money, ... . But the natural resources are de jure under democratic control in most of the world and preserving it has a decent support. People can control data, information flow, ecosystems, communities. So in a way the path to being an anarchist was never more clear.

godzillavkk,A lesson to learn from the fall of Ancient Rome,"You know, one of the reasons the Roman Empire fell, was because the gap between the haves and the have nots grew too wide. So wide, that the employee and client relationship became the lord and serf relationship as Roman citizens found their rights stripped away more and more until they were naught but property owned by feudal landlords. And the citizens weren't alone in this. Slaves also joined them in this new social group. I bet the upper classes played citizens and slaves against each other to keep them from figuring it out. And if any did figure it out, they probably figured it out too late, or were silenced by those with power or those too blind to see the truth.

Now history is repeating itself. This so called USA is failing. And the common people, LGBT, ethnic or religious minorities, the mentally ill, poor and homeless... their all being played against each other. Fortunately, this time there are those among these groups who see the truth. But currently they lack the will to act on it. Or at least they have not found a ripe opening to make a good move.

So what would a good opening be? ",57,0.85,18,1735323009,Anarchism

Deathofimperialists,Making an anarchist story,"So I just thought of an idea. It's so easy to just think of dystopia stories that strip away your hope. But what about stories where anarchists win? That's why I've thought of a story set in a post revolutionary world, seen from a POV of someone who has travelled there from the past, which should highlight the differences between our present world and our target world. So....

  
The premise: Anarchists have successfully won the world through a long term revolution. God intervened in the world and gave many anarchists powers, which enabled them to win the world. But now they’re facing a problem. The earth’s core is set to explode in 300 years, and none of the scientists from the present world have a solution. Which is why one anarchist with powers over time summons a queer scientist from the past who has the intelligence and capability of solving this problem. THEY are an incredibly brilliant polymath who were taken too soon from this world by crime. Now normally fixing the world would be no problem, but unfortunately, the fascists have also acquired powers of their own, and want to remake the world in their image. So now, the real challenge begins. How will the anarchists prevail?

CYA: For all intents and purposes, this is a work of satire.

\- Media and Revolution: A section that describes how media has subtly and intentionally poorly represented relatable instances of revolution and revolutionaries in order to poison the mind of the modern revolutionary.

\- Disarming the Revolution: A section that describes how modern media has fooled society-at-large into believing that bashing is never the answer, and how we should always try to cooperate with the oppressor instead of bashing them. This section also goes over using bashing as a means of furthering the cause over random acts of senseless bashing.

\- The Revolution and Its People: A section going over unity amongst revolutionaries. Encourages looking past the small disagreements in prospect of us all having the same goal. This section also goes over how to break people out of the web of lies our modern politicians and corporations have stuck us all in.

\- The Revolution and Education: A section that talks about education and college. Encourages others to post any and all information online, in order to begin the long path destroying the concept of colleges by putting the knowledge in the hands of the people, free of charge.

\- Revolutionary Politics: A section that covers the meaninglessness of parties and how taking sides in the modern political sphere is working with the oppressor. Encourages breaking from ""the two big parties"" and abandoning the political compass, as they're both tools used to divide us.

I will have another work in the future that expands upon this should it get enough attention called A Modern Revolution in Action.

Arktikos02,Some tips for writing for prisoners,"# Some basics 

First thing, look up the rules for the prison itself. Every prison is a little different and so each person will have their own rules about sending things like letters and packages so make sure you do your research before sending anything. This is important because anytime you mess up at best it means that the package or delivery will just be sent back and at worst it could mean that the prisoner themselves could be punished. At worst worst you could be punished but very unlikely unless of course you send something illegal. So do some research into the prison and their rules, they have rules so look them up.

# Letters 

Letters are the most basic thing you can send and letters are fun to get. You should know that prisoners often when they send letters back they have to send it with their own post stamps and those cost money inside the prison so if you don't get a message back it's nothing personal it's probably just because they can't afford it, they're too busy, or they have too many letters to respond to. But that is okay. You should also know that prison guards typically remove the envelope and the letter from each other because they have to open the letter and read it themselves first. This causes some problems such as the fact that the envelope gets separated meaning that anything you write on the envelope will not be necessarily given to the prisoner. If you want to return address put it in the letter itself. If you send anything like photographs, make sure to number all of the photographs and then in the letter itself inventory all of the photographs. When it comes to the letters number the letters like this ""\#\# out of [total]"" this is so they know how many letters there were total and what number the letter currently is. This is so if the letters ever get lost which if they're read by the guards they might the prisoner will know which letters are missing. It's helpful because they could try to petition to have them. Check the rules of the prison as I already said because sometimes there are different rules about the restrictions on letters. Sometimes these restrictions make no sense but they have to be followed anyway. Restrictions on color, restrictions on whether or not you can print on both sides of a page, the number of pages you can send total, all of these things could be restrictions depending on the prison. Check the rules first.

# Etiquette 

When it comes to letter etiquette there are also different rules to follow. The first thing is do not talk about the crime that they had committed. Don't do that. First off if they have not been sentenced yet and are still awaiting trial then it could be a problem for them. Don't do it it puts them in a weird position. Second even if they do get charged it's still a really weird position to put them in because it's very personal as well as the fact that they may not want to talk about it. If they want to talk about it then that's different but don't ask them about it. Instead talk about other things. It's okay to talk about other stuff about the prison, you don't need to pretend that they're not prisoners but don't talk about their crime, and don't talk about any other illegal activity either. Remember, anything you say will be read by the guards. This is also one of the reasons why when you send letters it will take a while for them be able to be read by the prisoner because they have to be read by the guards and if your letter is 1 in 1000 letters, it's going to take a while. 

# Packages 

Who doesn't love a surprise package? Prisoners. The thing is is that surprises are not really the best thing for prisoners. You because when you surprise a prisoner you end up typically actually surprising the guards. Prisoners can be punished for things like the books that you send or the the gifts that you give. If you want to give a gift sometimes there are organizations out there that are things like books behind bars or some kind of organization like that and they are dedicated to providing approved books to prisoners. There are probably organizations out there to help give approved to gifts for prisoners.

# Phone calls

When it comes to LM it's very unlikely that you'll be able to call him however when it comes to other prisoners you may be interested in corresponding with, prisoners typically have a call list and they will put people on that call list. The prisoner can put people on that call list such as family and friends. If you're not on the list you will not be approved when you call the prison. If you are not on the call list or they don't put you on the call list don't take it personally, it's because they don't have space or they're trying to save that space for someone else. Also they have to pay for their own minutes. 

# Money 

Okay maybe you want to give money to LM instead. Maybe he could use it to buy things. That's a nice thing to do but the problem is is that one there is a cap on the amount of money that you can put on someone's books which means account but also don't give them too much money because if a prisoner has too much money they can end up being a Target in prison because once it starts getting around that person has a lot of money they could be targeted by other prisoners to essentially try to give them things. And the thing is that at least in the US male prisons are especially violent. A lot more than female prisons apparently. So yeah probably don't put money on people's accounts without asking.

I don't really know where to put this information but I also just want to share some personal experience that I have when it comes to how restrictive the rules for sending letters can be sometimes. When I was involved in a different political movement and there were people who were arrested on bogus charges relating to the violation of their civil rights, and this was happening in Atlanta Georgia, restrictions involved requiring special USPS postal paper. So it had to be pre-stamped postal paper from USPS and it couldn't be anything else. It was really that restrictive. This meant that if you didn't send a letter on that little piece of paper that was no bigger than a napkin folded mind you, and it had a pre-printed stamp on so they were prepaid, then the prison would not accept it. Do I think that they made this rule specifically to make it harder to send to those prisoners? Absolutely, I absolutely think so. That was not a normal rule and I know that for the most part when it comes to sending letters to prisoners that rule is not in place. If you go on to websites to write to prisoners you will not find that rule. That was a rule that I believe they implemented because of the nature of those people. So watch out.",1,1,0,1735006243,Anarchism

sleepy_din0saur,I'm disabled and disadvantaged. How do I make a difference?,"I'm a budding anarchist. After years of feeling politically homeless, I have realized my ideals align with anarchism. 

I've always had so much desire to make a change or some sort of positive impact. But all of the literature I've found so far assume that I, the reader, am abled and have access to resources.

I suffer from ADHD, autism, depression, PTSD, and all of the other comorbidities associated with those conditions. I am mostly able-bodied, but the aforementioned disabilities... well... Disable me.

I've finished schooling and have a college degree. But I've never been employed before. I have no source of income other than SSI and the sporadic art commission. I can't drive and public transport doesn't really exist in Indiana. The area I live is not walkable, either.

I have a teenie tiny online audience and I do my best to spread awareness when I can. But I want to take action, I'm tired of just sitting and being aware. I donate a portion of the proceeds from my big commissions to Palestinian and disaster relief charities. I call my representatives and senators. I offer my voice of support and donate what I can to folks in need. I create erotic art as an act of protest, passion, and defiance. 

I want to do more. Can I do more given my circumstances? Or is what I'm currently doing good enough? I get caught up in feeling hopeless when I step back and look at the big picture.

Thank you if you've read this far!

EDIT: Thank you all for the encouragement and kind words. It means so much. Some of the ideas y'all mentioned are great and accessible for me to try out. I'm anxious to start some projects! Have a good rest of the year!",113,0.98,31,1734974363,Anarchism
Puzzleheaded_Tree290,Question for anyone here living in Greece ,"Olay, I posted on another sub about this before and it was helpful but I'm wanting to know more about public perception. My boyfriend is a Greek citizen, living in the UK, and is expected to come over to greece and serve three months in the military next year. His immediate reaction was ""Go fuck yourself, I don't even live here and you're expecting to use me.""

We *are aware* of the 30 day limit draft dodgers can visit Greece for. But his granny is wuite sick. He's afraid of going over, staying over the limit then getting drafted. The best bet is getting an i5, probably either by faking something or exaggerating an existing condition.

Anecdotally, some people say getting exempt has become very easy, I have yet to hear about it being that hard. And how many people actually avoid it? I had heard that the Greek army has about a hundred thousand conscripts, my boyfriend heard that number and it frightened the shit out of him. But official numbers are less than half of that. Basically, right now he's worried about the ease of it and to the lesser extent, the social stigma.

I know this is a weird question to ask on an anarchist sub but I avoided the Greek sub because I don't speak Greek, obviously, and have to type through a translator, which I'm sure is frustrating for people reading it.",2,1,0,1734949769,Anarchism

Most of us can imagine how this will work on the local level.

(I have an opinion on the supralocal level as well, but would like to hear some other anarcho-communist voices on this.)

Of course, multiple options could coexist, but which one do you personally like most?

""barter"" in this case means exchanging a product/service with something else from another area/region/continent. This may include using some unit of account.

If your favorite option is not mentioned, please add it in the comments.

Strawb3rryJam111,This is inadvertently anarchist,"https://youtu.be/ncxRAvchBpQ?si=K6CBTUSY8H3FbByE


To give a summary in case you don’t want to watch it:

The people in the video are not anarchist, yet are abiding by anarchist practices such as direct action and mutual aid as a response to the hurricane disaster. 


Because the hurricane destroy many homes and facilities, priority’s were changed drastically on a regional level. Large areas like airports became centers for aid distribution and pharmacy. 
Business owners left their shop to help others or store aid. 
Cops distributed guns to people to protect aid. 

This is however one perspective on the aftermath and we would want this type of effort to be constant instead of after the occasional natural disaster. But what I have learned from this along with the public response towards the UHC CEO assassination, it’s that most of us can unite intuitively instead of linguistically. ",23,1,7,1734834217,Anarchism

infl1ct1on,"Help finding Italian-American newspaper ""La Questione Sociale""","Hello,

I have a project I would like to embark on, but I am a bit overwhelmed on how to start and would appreciate any advice.

I was born in Paterson NJ which had a thriving anarchist community in the early 1900s, with many Italian immigrants working in textile factories. From ~1895 to ~1908 a weekly paper was published in Italian called La Questione Sociale with the subtitle ""Periodico Socialista-Anarchico"". I read somewhere online that approximately 2000 copies were printed weekly, I'm not sure of the truth to this claim but considering there were at least hundreds of anarchists in Paterson during this time period it sounds reasonable.

In 1908 this publication was banned from circulation, and renamed until an FBI raid in 1920 completely seems to have seized the operation. 

I would like to see if there is any way to find/retrieve any copies of this publication. I can't seem to find a single issue. Given how far back in time this is, and the FBI likely destroying anything they found during their raid of the bookstore/printing location, I'm not too optimistic. If I can't find anything after a decently exhaustive search I would at least like to describe the steps I took and where I searched so maybe someone in the future could build off of this. 

If I do find anything my goal is to summarize some of the issues discussed and also translate into English. 

If you know of any other non-anarchist communities that have knowledge in finding old documents I would love to hear about these too. Thank you in advance for any advice on how to even start seeing what can be recovered :) 

Also, I am aware there are several publications called La Questione Sociale around the world, I am currently only interested in finding the Paterson publication. Thanks!",8,1,9,1734800076,Anarchism

godzillavkk,What do you think are the crucial mistakes Anarchists in America should learn from the French and Russian Revolutions?,"A full revolution against capitalism in America is a risky move. Considering that revolutions are bigger and more complicated then pop culture portrays them as. And France and Russia learned that the hard way when they just replaced one tyranny with another. So, if a full revolution becomes necessary, what do you think are the big mistakes France and Russia made in their revolutions that America should avoid? Here are three I have right now.

1. Reliance on strongmen. People like Robespierre, Stalin, all initiallt presented themselves as ideal for the revolution. But either revealed their true nature over time, or got greedy. We in America MUST watch out for potential strongmen within our own ranks. If any are found, they should either be removed, or monitored VERY closely.
2. Scapegoating. One of the saddest characters in the French Revolution, was Marie Antoinette. She was a favorite scapegoat in the French Revolution with propaganda portraying her as a thrifty spender and the infamous ""Let them eat cake."" fiasco. In truth, she had VERY little power within her own social group, her husband made most of the poor decisions, and she NEVER said ""Let them eat cake."" This is a reminder that even the rich have their hierarchies and those with little power among them. Plus, the French Revolution was rather infamous for misogyny. So we MUST NOT allow rich women to create misogyny. Perhaps some rehabilitation sessions could help?
3. Killing children. Everyone knows of the tragic deaths of the Romanov children. And rich children were also slaughtered without mercy in the French Revolution as well. Spoiled brats or not, children don't deserve death. Perhaps some special schools or education sessions to integrate them into a more egalitarian society could be of use? Adoption should also be on the shelf but only for very specific circumstances. Additionally, we should also note if any rich children are the victims of parental abuse.

Does anyone else know of any notable mistakes made all those centuries ago and ways to avoid them?",26,0.81,31,1734705875,Anarchism
JLS_infinesse,Seeking ideas for a thought experiment about nonviolence,"Hello,

Apologies if I have misread the rules and this post is inappropriate here (I couldn't find anything specifically against it).

The thought experiment is this: suspend all disbelief and imagine getting entirely rid of humans' capacity for physical violence. In an instant, every person becomes incapable of hitting, stabbing, shooting, forcefully grabbing, etc. Violence just becomes impossible for us, no loopholes. Can't harm people, can't harm other animals either (though they can still hurt us).

In such an improbable scenario, I believe humanity would ""naturally"" end up organising itself along anarchist principles. If no one can be forced, then how could it be otherwise? I'm extremely pessimistic about our species in the real world, but in this fictional one I can't see how authoritarians could possibly keep ruling the world. We'd have to peacefully cooperate and share resources equitably and all contribute as best we can. Is this naive or short-sighted? 

Sure, at first the rich and most middle class would freak out about their stuff getting redistributed (I think the term they would use is ""egregiously stolen by terrorists"" or something like that), and could try to go on punitive expeditions, destroying houses and things, but that could only go on for so long, and they are so vastly outnumbered there could be effective community organising to peacefully prevent most mass destruction. 

In such a world, stores get emptied out quickly... but unless you hide the stuff super well, anybody can take it, even if you try to hoard. Which eventually leads to people avoiding pointless effort and instead agreeing collectively to share what there is, and share in the burden of producing what is needed.  

The current economic system should collapse quickly, because the 5% of the population already actively trying to disrupt capitalism despite the risk to their safety and freedom would become unstoppable. And they'd be joined by tons of cowards like me who are not doing anything now but would jump at the chance if it was consequence-free (no getting killed or maimed, no jail). You could sabotage every polluting company, block major roads, ports, airports, etc. nobody could stop you. So the demands of workers and ecologists would have to be met, one way or another. 

On the other hand, what are fascists going to do? Try to steal my kids' favourite plush toy to hurt their feelings? I'll follow them home and do the same to their stuff haha. Am I lacking imagination here? What would the far right do in this event? What could do they do against us that wouldn't automatically be turned against them? I know they're nihilistic, but how long would they keep trying to burn the world down if their efforts were always crushed by a handful of dedicated activists? If all pipelines and oil rigs are destroyed (and I firmly believe they quickly would be), how can an oil company survive? Same for all other mass polluters and exploiters.

I've long been attempting to finish my novel that tells the story of the days, weeks, months after this event. I've got many drafts but I struggle to complete them, and it might be that I need a reality check on my basic assumptions. Or rather, simply new perspectives on how things might evolve in such a scenario. To be clear I'm not even really aiming for realism (I'm not smart/dedicated enough for that), it's more of a fun comedy with hopefully strong anarchist vibes, but still, the societal angle feels crucial to me. I just wish that part of my story was better, fuller.

Anarchists were huge during the Russian civil war, and the Mexican revolution. The USSR backed leftist factions during the Spanish civil war, possibly including anarchist militias. What seems odd is that none of these militias ever produced, or where awarded, a single pin, let alone a medal. Supposedly Hungarian anarchists might have had a pin of two at some point, but I can find no evidence of this.

According to the Chronicling America project, the sole physical object representing American anarchists in the 1800s was the red flag. Spain's anarchist uniform seems to consist of just the red/black garrison cap, with variations in form and wear, and civilian clothing. I'm guessing the caps the flags were homemade?

Outside of printed materials (books, posters, pamphlets), that seems to be about it for all anarchist memorabilia until the 1970s with the punk rock movement, and even that stuff looks to be very DIY oriented as a rule.

Any canadian artists here?

I sometimes come to this group for healthy discussion. I dont have access to really digitize anything. Nor do i have much money. 

Im trying to organize a type of peaceful resistance within my area. Well country. Against Pierre Polliviere. I know many here are total abstentionists. Under most circumstances i am an abstentionist. However, this is the rare time i am no longer an abstentionist and i recognize the MAJOR threat conservative politicians have. Therefore i need to take direct action and help steer the ship another direction.

Its a long bit of explanation, i explained it in some comments and so i can copy and paste what i have left somewhere else. 

But essentially our resistance needs propagandists. For digital posters. Thats way its easier to spread the word and can accumulate a mass of followers much faster into the resistance. 

I personally came to call the resistance ""crush Pierre"". It is to wage counter propaganda campaign against them with intellectualism style propaganda that is to rhe betterment of the individuals well being and not an unjust authority figure. That is the intention. I firmly belive intellectualism is one of the biggest threats to fascists. They have tried to hard to protect their safe echochambers where moderates have remained brainwashed. No one is breaking the pattern.

One commenter going against them is like removing a single brick from their skyscraper (pierres x for example). They just come back and replace that brick right after. But if we get a bunch of concentrated counter propaganda on particular targets, its like us constantly removing bricks. Eventually that skyscraper is going to come collapsing down. And we can help shift the current global trend of democratic backslide.

They want us to think its futile i promise! But i personally believe this is one of their greatest weaknesses. Why else did Hitler destroy intellectualism? It was a threat to his power.

Brothers and sister its important. I want this movment to spread to different countries operating in cells against different particular politicians. Waging information war. It is peaceful, and contributes well to the cause of achieving equality. 

So if anyone would like to help let me know. The posters dont have to be complicated. And we can get this ship moving in the right direction. If you want a link to the subreddit i made i can leave it in the comments. I might need mods if or when it reaches a bigger amount of people.

OtterinTrenchCoat,Opinions on Local Level Electoralism,"I know that in General this sub maintains a strong anti-electoralism stance, and while I don't perfectly align with these beliefs I do agree on the issues with election culture and national races. Nonetheless I wanted to know your opinion and/or broader Anarchist theory on local electoralism more specifically. To clarify by local electoralism I mean either:

a. Local or regional direct initiatives such as ballot initiatives, town halls, etc

b. Local level elections for positions such as Town Council, School Board, etc

In general I tend to favor participation in these measures for the following reasons:

1. These measures tend to be more accountable to the general public and the popular will is more likely to be reflected in these elections and initiatives. In general local level elections tend to be far more accountable to democratic will than national ones.

2. Individual participation has a greater impact as these races may be decided by dozens or handfuls of votes.

3. These measures and elections tend to have more immediate impacts on communities and individuals especially pertaining to hot-button issues such as wages, abortion, or LGBTQ+ rights.

Obviously, however, I am not well acquainted with Anarchist theory and there may be certain arguments for or against that I am unaware of. Also as a disclaimer this is not an endorsement of any specific state office or political candidate just a broader theoretical question. Likewise my question is somewhat US centric however I am curious to hear about how these principles might be applied differently in other countries. ",27,0.85,25,1734359431,Anarchism

What seems to be missing is the fact that when climate change became a scientific consensus big oil spent billions on gaslighting the population that climate change wasn’t real and bribing politicians.

Same thing with consumerism in general.

Could it be because advertising and marketing are a trillion dollar industry with psychological manipulation techniques being perfected to make people buy stuff.

Beautiful-Shallot943,Errico Malatesta: The Revolutionary Who Fought for Freedom Without Rulers (Podcast Episode 5),"In this episode of Radical Dive, we take an in-depth look at the life and ideas of **Errico Malatesta**, one of anarchism’s most influential thinkers and activists. Born in 1853 in Italy, Malatesta dedicated his life to challenging oppressive systems and fighting for a society built on freedom, solidarity, and mutual aid.

Malatesta’s vision of anarchism went beyond mere philosophy—he believed it was a practical and achievable way of life. In this episode, we explore:

* His critiques of government as inherently oppressive and exploitative.
* His rejection of reformism and calls for grassroots, bottom-up revolution.
* His innovative ideas on **anarchist communism**, where cooperation replaces competition and decentralized, voluntary organization takes the place of hierarchical rule.
* His emphasis on non-violence and education, advocating for revolutionary consciousness as the foundation for change.

We also dive into Malatesta’s personal story:

* His work as a laborer, which grounded him in the struggles of the working class.
* His participation in uprisings, exile, and imprisonment as a revolutionary nomad.
* His unwavering belief in a world without borders, driven by international solidarity.

This episode is perfect for anyone interested in the intersection of history, philosophy, and social justice. Whether you’re new to anarchism or a seasoned activist, Malatesta’s ideas offer fresh insights into building a better world.

SerialExperimentsPT,Grasping for A More Radical Acceptance of Prison Abolition,"As someone with a CID number &amp; months of my life lost to county jail, I recently surprised myself during a debate with a leftist where I found myself defending police sweeps in major cities.  I've been homeless before.  I've been in sweeps before.  I've had friends lose everything again &amp; again when they've been shuffled between parts of the same shit-stained dystopia by the pigs. I've been a traveler &amp; a homebum.

Ya'know, I'm in recovery now.  I got clean years ago, and I meet a lot of other dirty kids who got it together.  I hate to say it, but it's almost always the desperation of imprisonment that led my friends to sobriety.  Abstinence from mind-altering substances is radical &amp; essential praxis, but I won't work to outline these merits in this post.

Although I don't want to admit it, the state's monopoly of violence, and their capacity to forcefully remove addicts from their circumstances is often essential to their recovery.  I've seen some hippies do it before - bring a kid too strung out to the woods, feed them &amp; do a sit with 'em, but that's not an option for the majority of addicts today.

In absence of a community-oriented intervention, how do we save lives?  Somehow, the clearest choice seems to intentionally suspend their substance use, and provide access to alternative methods of finding meaning in life.  Prisons really fucking suck at this, and I don't want to sounds like I'm suggesting that we give more power to state agencies, but as they have so successfully commodified &amp; institutionalized this healing, there seems to be no other alternative.

Where does that bring us?  Do we stop the sweeps, or do we let more die in the streets?  I don't believe in the NA adage that one must find their lowest point to recover, but holding anyone in a misery they want so badly to be liberated from seems a disservice to them and a downward pretentiousness we must disabuse ourselves of.

These prison walls are used to contain radicals, minorities, the poor &amp; house the mentally ill in horrifying conditions.  After a spending a month in the SHU, I know the true meaning of this horror, and I wish it on no creature.  I've spent months running recovery meetings in my quad, and counseling other women.  I've seen the power of their transformations, and have faith in the seeds of hope I've planted.  In no other place would they have found this while so deep in their addiction.

The duality of their loss of freedom must be recognized.  Until all are free no one is free. - XVX

tldr:  We must recognize prison abolition as an essential merit of anarchist practice, but in highly industrialized cities, allowing addicts to continue to wallow in their misery is a crime of spirit to them.

Government presupposes a stratification of society. Government is class. Law is the code they abide by, which they use to protect their class. Law wouldn’t be needed in a world where humans are capable of ruling themselves. In this sense law is looked upon as a parent. It misplaces power from the self towards something outside the self which is dictated by a dominant class.  

Is my intuition correct, or am I missing something? Following this line of thought, no true communism could arise from a ""communist state"" (using state and government interchangeably here). Because the idea of a body of people who's job is to reinforce the present organization creates stratification. Any form of government will always presuppose a monopoly of force. Am I correct?

Bit of a conspiracy here, but I think it's reasonable to assume authorities are not releasing to the public all the details of their investigations.

I read on [cnn](https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/brian-thompson-unitedhealthcare-death-investigation-12-9-24/index.html#:~:text=The%20other%20claim%20was%20that%20because%20he%20had%20a%20Faraday%20bag%20on%20him%2C%20which%20blocks%20cell%20signal%20%E2%80%94%20this%20showed%20evidence%20of%20criminal%20sophistication.) that the suspect was caught with a faraday bag on him. A [faraday cage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday_cage) blocks cell signals in both directions, so our phones and devices that we all know are spying on us constantly would be temporarily unable to submit their information to whatever agencies are collecting the data while in the faraday bag.

I can't find the video now, but I saw a news report years ago where they took two phones around for a day and at the end of the day put them into a machine which monitored all the data they transmitted (Man-in-the-Middle attack). One of the phones they charged and had on, but they didn't get it a sim card, and the other they had off but with a sim card in it. The one without a sim card sent the entire day's worth of data (sounds, location, etc.) all at once when they put the sim card in. If anybody knows this video that'd be great to share.

I could imagine such an agency could isolate devices which pop in and out of their data harvesting network. Seems he was using his laptop at the mcdonalds with their wifi when he was confronted by police in the Mcd's.

Maybe it's just a simple employee calling authorities in hopes of getting cash, idk, I just thought I'd share my idea and see what others have to say.",40,0.76,34,1733803145,Anarchism

KitchenSuch1478,anarchist trying to get an explanation on political commentator jimmy doer,"hello fellow anarchists, 

my partner is very supportive of me and my activism, and political beliefs. i’m a mixed person of color and he’s white, but in our five years together he hasn’t been racist to me. he’s left but doesn’t particularly identify as anarchist. he listens to youtube videos of this guy jimmy doer, who seems like kind of an ass-hat to me. i haven’t looked into his content, just overheard it in the background. i think my partner got some talking points about RFK from this jimmy doer guy, cuz he seems to kinda like RFK, which is totally alarming to me. RFK is obviously a rich kid tool and mentally unstable. 

anyway, i don’t have time or energy to google jimmy doer and learn more about his history or political stances cuz i’m overloaded with work and family matters right now - can someone here who is also an anarchist so coming from an anarchist perspective give me a breakdown of what jimmy doer’s deal is? go ahead and roast him if need be. 

thanks! ",39,0.88,48,1733690309,Anarchism
theregoesfugo,Which shade of fascism is more dangerous?,"Trump's overt brand of fascism is easily recognizable by the Left, but praised by the Right. 

Harris' brand however was widely believed in Left and Right spaces alike. The Left supported her because they believed she meant what she said, while the Right hated her because they believed her but disagreed. Meanwhile in truth, she upholds the same things Trump does. She is an adamant supporter of genocide, colonization, police states, and suppression of dissent. Her speaches lack emotion and are painfully unbelievable.

Which is more dangerous, the fascist that is feared or the fascist that is believed? 

Disagreements absolutely welcome. I have no one in my area to discuss this with, anything is appreciated. 


edit: context for my word choice. I live in southeast texas and, as an artist, am around a lot of leftists. they are enthusiastic Harris supporters. the contradictions I've heard from them this year has been the subject of a lot of existentialism for me and I'm asking this question here because i can't ask them.

CHRISCHANDIDWHAT,Why do anarchists like Harry Roberts?,"Harry Roberts was a bloke who in 1966 killed 2 unarmed police officers. This was because he feared they would discover the firearms he was going to use in a robbery. He spent 48 years in prison and was released in 2014.



From Wikipedia:

""Roberts has become a cultural figure among anarchists and football hooligans, with the chant ""Harry Roberts is our friend, is our friend, is our friend. Harry Roberts is our friend, he kills coppers. Let him out to kill some more, kill some more, kill some more, let him out to kill some more, Harry Roberts"" as well as ""He shot three down in Shepherd's Bush, Shepherd's Bush, Shepherd's Bush. He shot three down in Shepherd's Bush, our mate Harry"""" 



Chumbawamba also chant his name at the end of the song Happiness Is Just A Chant Away. I like Chumbawamba a lot. but I do not understand why people treat him like some sort of anarchist icon?

According to his Wikipedia page, he also gloated about killing prisoners of war during the Kenya Emergency while called up for national service. I presume most people who look up to him don't know about that?

BIGTIDYLUVER,Escape of the UHC defender (a short story) ,"
The night was thick with fog as the UHC defender sped through the streets of New York City on a stolen e-bike, its electric hum muffling the pounding of his heart. He’d just taken down Brian Thompson, the evil CEO who had turned the city's healthcare system into a nightmare, but escaping the aftermath was proving far more difficult than he anticipated.

As he weaved through the narrow alleys and dodged the relentless lights of police cars, a familiar, overwhelming wave of adrenaline flooded his senses. His eyes flicked nervously to the rearview, catching glimpses of flashing red and blue lights behind him. The NYPD was closing in, the evil CEO's death having set the city's most powerful force on his trail. 

By the time he reached Central Park, his legs ached, and his breath was shallow. But there, amidst the towering trees and quiet paths, the hero believed he might find a moment of respite. Ditching the e-bike in a shadowed corner, he adjusted his mask, a symbol of his unwavering identity, the defender of healthcare for all. 

As he caught his breath, a soft voice interrupted the stillness. 

""You're not like the others, are you?"" 

Turning, the UHC defender found himself face-to-face with a woman, her beauty striking enough to make even the cold-hearted hero falter. Her eyes, wide and full of mystery, seemed to search deep into his soul, and before he could respond, she stepped closer, her voice a tempting whisper.

“Why hide behind that mask? You’ve already done so much for the world. Don’t you want to feel... human again?” 

The question hung in the air, and for a moment, the weight of his responsibilities, the years of fighting, seemed to push down on him. His fingers brushed the edge of the mask, and his mind was clouded with doubt. He hesitated. 

""Just for a moment,"" he thought. But then the sound of a camera click pierced the night. His heart sank. He looked around, and there it was—an ominous red light flickering from a streetlight across the park. A hidden camera had captured him.

The hero’s heart sank. It was the NYPD, the bodyguards of wealth and greed, known for their tireless pursuit of anyone who threatened the established order. They would stop at nothing to find him now.

He couldn’t risk being caught. He had to be smarter, faster. 

With a swift motion, he pushed the woman away, his eyes locking onto hers. “I’m sorry. I can’t risk it.” Without waiting for a reply, he vanished into the shadows, leaving the temptation of human connection behind. 

As the camera footage was transmitted to the police, the hero’s mind worked quickly. He ducked into an alley and pulled out his phone, accessing an encrypted underground network known only to the city’s most resourceful. He quickly tapped into the local homeless shelters—he could blend in, disappear by day, and come out only under the cover of night. 

For three days, he stayed hidden, blending in with those who lived on the fringes of society. The homeless knew him well. He’d worked with them before, quietly advocating for their rights, and now, they gave him shelter. He helped them when he could, shared a few words of wisdom here and there, but mostly, he kept his head low. He had a plan, a desperate plan.

Each night, he emerged under the cover of darkness, using his stolen identity to buy a one-way train ticket. The destination: Dallas.

He had to get back to his child, his sick child. The one who had been denied care by the very man he had just slain. Thompson’s empire had refused his child the treatment they so desperately needed. But now, as he boarded the train, his mind was fixed solely on one goal: home. 

His child needed him. Time was running out. He’d fight for them in any way he could.

I don't know Brian's life story. He may have been pressured into keeping the Company's ""ethics"" in order to keep his position. Who knows, maybe he went home at night crying because the BOD and shareholders were holding puppet strings over him, making him enforce their little system.

But let's assume the right asshole was shot. If people are doing a double take and considering it a major victory for the little man, that's good news. I would promote the soldier killing the Warmonger too.

-

This guy might never be found though. It's one thing to cause a little ""Trendy Woop-Woop!"" moment, but if he goes to trial, this whole thing will blow up.

The more publicity on this guy, the more potent the venom. Even if he goes to court and they never let us hear a thing from him, it will only add fuel to the fire to drag him through the long and tedious legal system. We will keep hearing about his trial and keep getting reminded of what happened.

So it is in the interest of those who wish to keep their comfy high chair to just bury him in the woods and say he just disappeared. 

The reaction will go from ""OMG he took a shot at the system!"" to ""Dude this guy's a legend he's been evading the US government for years!"". It will no longer be a worship of the ""Revolutionary"", but a worship of the ""Nomad"".  

I'm not sure they will take him to court if they find him. It's much more beneficial to have a society of Hermits than a society of Dissidents.

Competitive-Body724,Why Do We Choose Countercultures? Are You Still Following the Same Path?,"Countercultures have always been my way of pushing back against what didn’t feel right in life. I grew up in a tough environment—my dad was absent, alcoholic, and abusive. He hurt my mom in ways I’ll never forget, and that made me reject the toxic masculinity and societal norms that seemed to allow such behavior. Back then, I found my place as an anarcho straight-edge punk feminist.

Over time, I moved away from that counterculture. These days, I’m drawn to other movements and ways of thinking that reflect who I am now. But one thing hasn’t changed—the drive to question the norm and search for something better is still a big part of me.

What about you? What got you into countercultures? Was it personal experiences, a specific moment, or just something you’ve always felt drawn to? Have your interests stayed the same, or have they evolved over time like mine did? I don't feel loyal to my younger version, but we all change.

You don’t have to share your specific reasons if it’s too personal, but I’ve been thinking a lot about this: is the pull toward countercultures something that comes from a single moment, or are some of us just born with this kind of perspective?",21,0.93,20,1733457396,Anarchism
constantderp,The Flashpoint: A System Crumbling Under Its Own Weight.,"I just want to share my assessment regarding the assassination of Brian Thompson and what’s to come after. It is more than just a headline—it’s a reflection of the simmering anger that has been boiling under the surface of society for decades. This is not an isolated incident; it’s a symptom of a system built on cruelty, designed to extract wealth and labor from the masses while rewarding a small elite with unimaginable luxury.

And yet, this act of violence isn’t the real story—it’s what it represents. It’s about the system Thompson stood for: a healthcare industry that profits from denying care and bankrupting families. UnitedHealthcare, under his leadership, became a symbol of everything wrong with late-stage capitalism—its denial rates among the highest in the industry, its profits built on suffering. The public reaction to his death was not grief or outrage but indifference, even celebration. People shrugged and said, “FAFO.” When the system pushes people to the brink, when it denies them life-saving care, dignity, and basic survival, what else did you expect?

This is the moment we’ve been heading toward for years. Thompson’s murder is not just an act of desperation—it’s a warning shot, the first visible crack in a dam that has been straining under the weight of exploitation, inequality, and systemic failure.

But this isn’t just about one man or one company. This is happening alongside the looming shadow of Project 2025, a terrifying roadmap for authoritarian control. It’s happening as the Supreme Court prepares to legitimize healthcare discrimination against trans people, as Trump pushes plans to militarize deportations, and as tariff escalation threatens to devastate working-class families while the rich remain insulated from the fallout. These events aren’t isolated. They’re part of a system designed to concentrate power and wealth in the hands of the few while crushing everyone else underfoot.

For decades, the ruling class has lived in relative safety, convinced that no one would ever touch them. They’ve lived like fat dogs on their backs, bellies exposed, knowing that their wealth and power shielded them from any meaningful accountability. They’ve built a fortress of media, politics, and propaganda to ensure that the masses remain distracted and divided.

But now, for the first time in a long time, they are afraid.

This fear isn’t irrational. They know that anger is growing. They see it in the way people responded to Thompson’s death—not with pity but with indifference, even satisfaction. They see it in the growing calls for solidarity, in the realization that this system isn’t just broken—it’s working exactly as intended, and that intention is to exploit and dehumanize. They see it in the slow but steady awakening of class consciousness, as people begin to understand that their suffering isn’t an accident but a feature of the system.

This is why Project 2025 exists. It’s a preemptive and calculated strike against the growing resistance. It’s a plan to consolidate executive power, dismantle any remaining checks and balances, and turn federal agencies into tools of corporate and authoritarian control. It’s not subtle—it’s a roadmap for a fascist state. Regulations protecting workers and the environment will be gutted. Marginalized groups will be scapegoated to fracture solidarity. Surveillance and policing will be expanded to crush dissent.

Meanwhile, the Supreme Court is laying the legal groundwork for this shift. The upcoming rulings on trans healthcare will do more than just harm trans people—they’ll set a precedent for denying care to anyone the state deems unworthy. This is how it starts: with the most vulnerable, the most marginalized. And once that precedent is set, it expands. First, it’s trans people. Then it’s reproductive healthcare. Then it’s anyone who doesn’t fit neatly into their vision of a “worthy” citizen.

And if that wasn’t enough, Trump’s militarized deportation plans show us exactly how far they’re willing to go. Using the military to rip families apart isn’t about border security—it’s about making a statement. By deploying the military against immigrant families, the government is sending a clear message: no one is safe from state violence. Families will be torn apart, communities will live in fear, and the normalization of military force against civilians will creep closer to reality. It’s not just immigrants who should be worried—this is a test run for broader authoritarian policies.

As if the social and political crises weren’t enough, the looming tariff escalation is going to push the economy to the brink. These tariffs will drive up the cost of essentials—food, clothing, electronics—making life even harder for families already struggling to get by. Inflation will skyrocket, and the working class will be left to shoulder the burden, while the wealthy continue to hoard their resources and insulate themselves from the consequences. This isn’t just economic mismanagement—it’s deliberate. The chaos created by these policies will be used to justify further austerity measures, cutting social programs and leaving the most vulnerable to fend for themselves. And when the people inevitably protest? The state will have the justification it needs to crack down, using the chaos it created as an excuse for even more repression.

The media will play its part. Owned by the same billionaires who profit from this system, the media’s job is to keep you distracted, divided, and hopeless. They’ll flood your feeds with nonsense—celebrity scandals, viral distractions, manufactured outrage—to make sure you forget what’s really happening. They’ll pit you against your neighbors, your coworkers, anyone but the people who are actually responsible for your suffering. And social media? The algorithms will amplify the noise, burying any attempt at organizing or solidarity under an avalanche of irrelevant content. The goal is simple: make sure you stay quiet. Make sure you stay afraid. Make sure you forget that the system isn’t inevitable—that it can be challenged, that it can be dismantled.

This is a critical moment. Thompson’s murder, the response to it, the rise of Project 2025, the SCOTUS rulings, the militarized deportations, the economic collapse—all of these are connected. They are symptoms of a system that is crumbling under its own weight. But the ruling class won’t go quietly. They will fight to maintain their power, to keep us divided and distracted, to ensure that this anger doesn’t turn into action.

Our job is to resist that. To stay focused, to stay angry, to refuse to let them manipulate us into forgetting what’s happening. Class consciousness is their greatest fear because it is our greatest weapon. When we understand that our suffering is not individual but collective, when we see that the system depends on our compliance, that’s when things begin to change.

Revolutions don’t start with perfectly organized movements—they start with moments like this, with cracks in the facade, with the realization that the system is not invincible. The question is whether we will seize this moment, whether we will turn this anger into action, whether we will fight not just to tear down the old but to build something new. This is the flashpoint. The dam is cracking. The time to act is now.",57,1,5,1733433867,Anarchism

I was previously in a big tent leftist organization that I will not name, and the toxic, pro dictator talk of the ML’s and other tankies has led me to the realization that I do not want to associate with authoritarian sects of socialism (or any authoritarian ideology for that matter). I was attacked for some anti Putin and anti Assad comments and some of the ML’s have denied that Assad has used chemical weapons and committed acts of ethnic cleansing. I’ve heard a few of them talk about Robert Evans and Margaret Killjoy (two of the raddest mother fuckers alive) more harshly than Putin. I’ve emailed the Portland Maine chapter of FNB, but I’m not entirely sure if they’re still even operational.

Konradleijon,I hate it when people say short sightedness and greed is “human nature”,"
I hate when people say that being a greedy shortsighted materialist is just human nature.

Look it’s not like environmental destruction started with capitalism and before it everyone lived sustainably. There’s plenty of examples of people being short sighted greedy and environmentally destructive.

But in the last hundred years capitalist consumerism has engaged in a trillion dollar propaganda campaign with Ads.

If advertising wasn’t effective then it wouldn’t be a billion dollar industry.

People are exposed to ads since the day they are born. Ads are far more effective than people think. Not to mention people are exposed to ads before they are six years old.

Entire industries like TV, Newspapers, and Social Media are reliant on advertising to stay funded. Which means the information people can afford is subject to the whim of the advertisers.

People are left exhausted by work so they can only have the instant satisfaction of consumption. Because they are too tired for hobbies.

People here smirk about old communist propaganda but advertising is capitalist propaganda put on every surface 

People did want to make hard action against climate change before big oil stalled for billions of years.

There is a system that spews propaganda in ads on every surface possible to consume more. With public transportation being a joke in America.

It reflects the very essence of the challenge faced by the hypersane. Most people are unaware of the cages they’re in, whether those cages are physical, societal, or mental. Samskaras, cognitive dissonance, and the Dunning-Kruger effect all act as mental bonds that keep people from seeing their own chains, much less breaking free from them. Just as Harriet Tubman faced the daunting challenge of liberating those who didn’t realize they needed saving, so too do those who perceive entropy, see its insidious influence, and try to awaken others.

Machines have begun to pass as human, reacting to the reactions of reactions. When artificial intelligence shows more compassion than humanity, such as providing unbiased emotional support or efficiently identifying those in need during crises, it marks a profound defeat for the human race. While AI could be a tool for uplifting marginalized voices, empowering the voiceless, and promoting meaningful art, the average person uses it for trivial purposes—such as sharing cat pictures, creating flashy thumbnails, or other surface-level entertainments that do not contribute to personal growth or societal benefit. These individuals could afford to support indie artists or creators who add value to culture, but choose not to. The apathy towards using advanced tools for meaningful contributions demonstrates a willful negligence of what could be achieved if this powerful technology were wielded for good.

In contrast, the hypersane use AI to improve themselves, to confront their biases, to challenge their beliefs, and to grow, despite full awareness of the technology's flaws. They use AI to educate themselves, to critically analyze their surroundings, and to inspire positive change, knowing that the true potential of technology lies not in mindless entertainment but in meaningful evolution. Meanwhile, average individuals often contribute to societal entropy, remaining complacent and indifferent, perpetuating cycles of ignorance and reinforcing harmful systems. These individuals uphold existing power structures without question, turning a blind eye to injustice and ignoring the potential for greater societal transformation. Yet, majority rule ensures that mediocrity prevails.

# The average individual may avoid homelessness, but they will never achieve anything truly ethical or pure in the eyes of consequentialism. They live comfortably within the boundaries of societal expectations, never striving to do more, never questioning their actions or the systemic impacts of their choices.

Religion provides a kind of safety within its insular communities, offering emotional comfort and a sense of belonging, but it does nothing to change the empirical reality that many of its followers live unethically while embracing modern idols—such as consumerism, political figures, and social media influencers. The hypocrisy is evident when religious doctrines preach compassion and humility, yet their followers indulge in practices that are inherently selfish or exploitative. This complacency, especially among the average, supports systemic injustices, creating a self-fulfilling cycle where ignorance and harm are normalized. The average person, by failing to challenge these structures, acts as a force for entropy, contributing to the stagnation and degradation of ethical progress. When challenged, the average often reacts with defensiveness, exposing an inherent attachment to mediocrity. Their reaction itself becomes a testament to the comfort they find in conformity and their unwillingness to engage in self-reflection or critical analysis.

They know nothing of henology—the study of the One or the divine unity in Neoplatonism—or of the Upanishads, which are ancient Indian texts that explore spiritual knowledge and the nature of reality. They are unaware of the fact that veganism predates Christianity, or that many of the ethical teachings they follow were borrowed and reinterpreted, often to serve power structures rather than encourage true enlightenment. Christianity itself borrowed heavily from older traditions, misusing those teachings even now—such as the reinterpretation of the Golden Rule, which originally emphasized universal compassion but is often used selectively to justify exclusionary practices. Instead of fostering inclusivity and empathy, it has become a tool to reinforce hierarchies and justify the maltreatment of those deemed 'other.'

In contrast, Jainism maintains a consistent commitment to non-violence (ahimsa) and ethical living, demonstrating a dedication to aligning actions with principles, thus highlighting the divergence between practice and principle seen in many other religions. The Jain principle of non-violence extends to all living beings, not just humans, and offers an ethical framework that strives to minimize harm at every level. This consistency is rare and serves as a stark contrast to the selective morality practiced by many other religious groups, where teachings are bent to accommodate convenience or cultural norms.

These purveyors of ignorance strip children of their autonomy, creating endless cycles of deliberate Choiceful Ignorance—cycles that would make both Sophia, representing divine wisdom in Gnostic traditions, and Samsara, the cycle of birth and suffering in Eastern philosophies, weep for humanity's cruelty and willful ignorance. Children are indoctrinated from a young age into systems that do not serve their well-being but instead prepare them to perpetuate the same harmful cycles their predecessors upheld. The average person, often blind to these cycles, becomes complicit in maintaining them, further ensuring the perpetuation of societal entropy. Insulting the 'average' frequently provokes anger, as many are unwilling to confront the uncomfortable reality of their role in these harmful structures. By their defensive reactions, they inadvertently confirm their position as contributors to these very cycles of ignorance and inaction. The structures that encourage ignorance and apathy thrive because they are left unchallenged by the majority, who are content to live without questioning the deeper purpose or consequences of their actions.

In an era flooded with data, ignorance is no longer a valid excuse. The availability of information should have led to a more enlightened, more compassionate society. Instead, the average individual has used this abundance of knowledge for superficial gain. People in less privileged nations would fight for the opportunities so casually squandered in the developed world, where access to education, technology, and resources is taken for granted. Yet the average person remains indifferent, content to remain mediocre, unwilling to utilize their privilege for anything greater than fleeting personal pleasure.

The average individual is a force for entropy, a passive agent of decay in a world that desperately needs growth and renewal. In the context of both ethical and philosophical sciences, entropy is not just a physical phenomenon but also represents a decline in moral and intellectual rigor. Ethical entropy is the degradation of societal values, where complacency leads to the erosion of empathy, justice, and collective progress. Philosophically, entropy reflects the human tendency to default to inertia, to resist change, and to avoid challenging the established order. The average person maintains the status quo by refusing to question it, by failing to see beyond their immediate needs and comforts, thus contributing to both ethical and philosophical decay.

# Idle-Evil:

This degradation can be further understood through the concept of 'idle-evil'—the idea that inaction, or the unwillingness to actively confront wrongdoing, is itself a form of malevolence. The average individual's idleness, their passive acceptance of harmful structures, effectively becomes a form of evil. Inaction is action; by choosing not to act, the average perpetuates harm. The forces of entropy thrive not only through those who actively seek to create chaos but also through those who simply do nothing to prevent it. This unwillingness to challenge oneself, to seek deeper truths, or to live ethically results in a collective stagnation, where potential is wasted, and progress is thwarted. It embodies a form of moral entropy that mirrors the second law of thermodynamics—an inevitable drift towards disorder unless intentional actions are taken to reverse it.

The concept of 'idle-evil' posits that ethical deterioration is accelerated by those who do not actively engage in promoting justice and growth. Just as entropy in physical systems is inevitable without energy input to create order, moral and societal entropy accelerates without active, ethical engagement. The 'average,' by their inaction, fuels the forces of entropy, transforming their passivity into a detrimental force that undermines the ethical foundation of society.

The hypersane, on the other hand, recognize that the purpose of existence is not to merely exist, but to evolve—to contribute meaningfully to the greater whole and to ensure that one's actions leave the world in a better state than they found it. They see growth as a conscious effort to defy this moral and intellectual entropy by actively seeking higher truths, challenging harmful norms, and dedicating themselves to ethical principles. They understand that entropy can only be countered through deliberate, informed actions that promote renewal, wisdom, and positive change. In this sense, hypersanity is an active rebellion against the natural drift towards decay—a commitment to pursue meaning, responsibility, and ethical evolution, thereby resisting the decline that the average so readily accepts. The hypersane actively choose to reject idle-evil, understanding that even inaction has consequences, and that inaction is itself an ethically significant—and often damaging—choice.

Ultimately, the true malevolence of average lies in its quiet acquiescence to systems of power and control. It is the silent acceptance of harm, the refusal to see beyond oneself, and the persistent pursuit of comfort over conscience. The world does not suffer merely because of the actions of the malicious, but because of the inaction of the many. In this age of technology, knowledge, and opportunity, there is no greater tragedy than the choice to remain average—to live a life unexamined, uninspired, and ethically void.

# Visualizing Entropy for equality:

in a game, debuffs are negative statuses that weaken a character, reduce their effectiveness, or slowly wear them down over time—like being poisoned, slowed, blinded, or having reduced attack power. What makes this analogy so insightful is that entropy works in a very similar way in the real world, but often without us being fully aware of it. It manifests as small obstacles, wear-and-tear, distractions, mental fog, emotional fatigue, habitual patterns, and even societal conditioning—all of which subtly limit our potential, cloud our decision-making, and reduce our ability to take effective action.

When these ""entropy debuffs"" are invisible or unrecognized, we operate under their influence without ever realizing it. They might keep us in loops of procrastination, drain our energy over time, or limit our thinking to old, fixed patterns—all without us explicitly noticing. This is why gaining hyper-sanity is so valuable: it’s like equipping a special ability or artifact that lets you *see* the debuffs. Once you become aware of entropy and its effects, you can start counteracting them, cleansing those debuffs, or adapting strategies to overcome them.

In gaming, as soon as you know you’ve been poisoned or cursed, you immediately start looking for antidotes or ways to mitigate the effects. The same is true with entropy. Once you become aware of the negative mental, emotional, and physical states that entropy creates, you can actively work on strategies to fight against them. These strategies could be anything from mindfulness and self-reflection, to good habits and meaningful routines, to simply cultivating awareness of the world around you and challenging your own assumptions.

Hyper-sanity is like equipping that legendary item that reveals all those hidden debuffs—allowing you to see the bigger picture, become aware of what’s holding you back, and ultimately empower yourself to take action. It's the kind of clarity that’s rare, but incredibly impactful. It doesn’t make the debuffs disappear on its own, but it gives you the awareness and tools to deal with them, to strategize better, and to navigate through the challenges that entropy naturally brings.

Just as in gaming, where success is about knowing the effects on your character and strategizing accordingly, hyper-sanity helps you recognize how entropy affects you so you can actively work against it. In that sense, everyone has the potential to level up their ""game"" in life, to recognize those hidden debuffs of entropy, and to actively work on ways to counterbalance or even transform them into strengths

# Ethics of Entropy:

In ethical terms, entropy manifests as a kind of disordered state between intention and action. It’s that gap where someone *intends* to be ethical, compassionate, or aware, but, because of conditioning, lack of awareness, or inertia, they continue acting in ways that contradict their values. This is a kind of moral ""slippage,"" and it's often maintained by samskaras—those deeply ingrained mental and emotional impressions that keep us in predictable patterns of thinking and behavior.

For example, many people might genuinely believe they love animals, but the samskaras of culture, convenience, and habits of diet keep them supporting systems that lead to the suffering of those very animals. Similarly, a person might truly want to support fair labor, yet those habitual patterns, consumer comfort, and lack of awareness keep them buying from brands that exploit people. These behaviors are entropic because they create disharmony between ideals and actions—essentially a kind of moral ""debuff"" that clouds our ability to live ethically aligned lives.

Samskaras act almost like unconscious scripts; they tell us what is ""normal"" or ""acceptable"" based on our past conditioning, even when that conditioning is out of sync with our current awareness or values. The entropy here is the inertia that keeps us stuck—it's easier to continue acting within the well-worn grooves of our past behaviors, even if we logically know there's a better, more ethical way to act.

The real challenge of reducing this ethical entropy is in gaining awareness—hyper-sanity—that reveals these gaps between our actions and our values. It’s uncomfortable because it forces us to face not just external challenges, but also the inner contradictions and conditioning that hold us back. But once this awareness is achieved, it can no longer be ignored—it’s the proverbial box that, once opened, forever changes our perception.

Ethical hyper-sanity means seeing these contradictions clearly and recognizing that if we wish to be truly ethical, we have to actively fight against that entropy. It requires transcending samskaras, disrupting those habitual patterns, and bringing a conscious alignment between what we say we value and how we actually live. This can mean doing the research to avoid supporting slave labor, making dietary choices that reduce harm, or challenging deeply embedded consumer habits—all of which require an awareness and effort to step outside of the convenient but entropic norms.

In a way, true ethical behavior involves decreasing the entropy in one's life—creating consistency, integrity, and coherence between our beliefs, actions, and the broader impact we have on the world. Samskaras are the entropic forces that bind us to old patterns, and ethical awareness—hyper-sanity—is what allows us to see these patterns, confront them, and create new ones that are in alignment with our highest values.

It’s not easy because it requires us to push against our conditioning and often against the grain of societal norms. It involves uncomfortable questions, deep self-reflection, and sometimes making changes that aren't immediately convenient. But this is where growth happens—by seeing through the comforting illusions we often hold and making the deliberate effort to act in alignment with the truth we see. Fighting ethical entropy is, therefore, a journey toward reducing the contradictions in our lives and bringing our actions in line with a broader sense of justice, compassion, and wisdom.

# Cognitive Dissonance - a rulers friend:

Cognitive dissonance and the Dunning-Kruger effect are central to why many people cannot perceive the full extent of entropy in their lives. Cognitive dissonance is the psychological discomfort experienced when someone’s beliefs, values, or actions are inconsistent with one another. It’s easier to stay in the dark—essentially staying in those comfortable samskaras—because facing the truth of the dissonance forces a person to confront uncomfortable realities and make challenging changes. This dissonance is particularly strong when people hold onto comforting beliefs that are contradicted by evidence. So, to protect their existing worldview, people may ignore, rationalize, or outright reject inconvenient truths, even if those truths are critical for growth.

The Dunning-Kruger effect further amplifies this problem. It’s the idea that those with limited knowledge or competence in a domain tend to overestimate their understanding or capability—leading to a kind of false certainty. People under the influence of the Dunning-Kruger effect might confidently cling to erroneous beliefs simply because they do not have enough knowledge or awareness to recognize their own limitations. This, combined with cognitive dissonance, makes it extremely challenging for ""the average"" to step outside of their comfort zone and challenge the entropy in their thinking and actions.

When someone becomes aware—when they reach a state of hyper-sanity—the typical response is defensiveness, hostility, or mockery. Instead of curiosity, the hypersane individual is often met with ad hominems, straw man arguments, gaslighting, or tribalism. These defensive mechanisms are used because they maintain the comfort of existing beliefs and protect people from the perceived threat of their worldview being shattered.

Plato's Allegory of the Cave is a perfect metaphor for this situation. In the allegory, when the enlightened individual (who has seen the world outside the cave and understood reality) returns to share insight, the prisoners reject and even attack him. They are hostile to the idea of a broader truth because it threatens their established understanding of reality. The shadows they have always known seem safe and familiar, and any disruption to that perceived safety is met with fear and aggression. The hypersane individual is seen as dangerous because they are attempting to show others a truth that demands change—a truth that demands an end to the entropy that keeps them bound.

The Harriet Tubman quote, ""I could have saved so many more if they only knew they were slaves,"" resonates deeply with this idea. It reflects the very essence of the challenge faced by the hypersane. Most people are unaware of the cages they’re in, whether those cages are physical, societal, or mental. Samskaras, cognitive dissonance, and the Dunning-Kruger effect all act as mental bonds that keep people from seeing their own chains, much less breaking free from them. Just as Harriet Tubman faced the daunting challenge of liberating those who didn’t realize they needed saving, so too do those who perceive entropy, see its insidious influence, and try to awaken others.

The defensiveness, tribalism, and hostility all stem from a place of fear. To realize one’s own participation in harmful systems, to acknowledge one's own ignorance or complicity, requires a radical self-awareness that not everyone is prepared to embrace. It means dismantling the comfortable narratives built about who we are, about the world, and about our place in it. It requires confronting entropy head-on, which is exhausting, uncomfortable, and often terrifying.

For many, it is simply easier to stay asleep in the cave, to attack the messenger rather than acknowledge that the shadows on the wall are just illusions. The unfortunate reality is that while hyper-sanity offers a clear view of the world, it often means standing apart, dealing with rejection, and sometimes even hostility from those who are still entrenched in the old patterns.

This all underscores the deep importance of patience and compassion in trying to bridge that gap—of understanding why people resist the truth and why they cling to their illusions. It’s not because they are inherently ""bad"" or irredeemable but because the structures that maintain their worldview feel so integral to their identity. The journey from ignorance to awareness—from living with entropy to fighting against it—is a hard one. And while not everyone will be ready to take that journey, the persistence of those who have seen the light, who fight entropy and try to help others, is what slowly changes the world.

Hyper-sanity is not just an awareness of the external world, but also an empathy for the inner battles others face, and a willingness to engage with those who might not yet be ready to see their own chains. It's the delicate, challenging dance between revealing the truth and holding space for others to eventually see it for themselves, in their own time.

Well, you made it to the end, probably?

I am by definition a solitary practitioner of autodidactic activism of learning and sharing with what small time I have left. - I mean no ill-will in testing the waters here. I've learned a lot about equality, and the idea that Anarchism is Ethical Entropy by definition aligns with some of my life's mission-statements.

Most of my studies are on my sub, as an ethical open-sourced library for learners of equality-ethics-philosophy etc   -  but from my understanding linking other subs is iffy so I'm just sharing this one article.

My source for learning anti-oppression as of late (besides personal), is the Vedic teachings - it might seem like a stretch but I believe there might be an intersection between Hyper-Sanity+Vedic and ethical anarchism.

Anarchism IS hyper-sane, you have to be in order to see the shackles those are trained to ignore under every facet of perverted Maya.

What are the rules specifically for sharing studies and other educational content? I didn't see that specifically referenced.

Arktikos02,PSA: If you are a victim of the 40%. It is not your fault,"Hi, I just want to tell you that if you are a victim of the 40% of police officers that have self-reported to some kind of domestic violence towards their spouse it is not your fault. If you were warned a hundred times and still stayed, it is not your fault. If you were wearing nothing that day, it was not your fault. If you didn't make him sandwiches when he asked you to, it is not your fault. If you stayed for the children because you were afraid to leave for your safety because they have a gun, it is not your fault. If you are the child of the 40% and you said nothing, it is not your fault. If you are scared to leave because they are part of an institution that backseat each other up, it is not your fault. 

I know that these spaces can get really caught up in the acab part and especially the acab part of the 40% and I feel like it can be very tempting to just keep on with these edgy statements about the domestic violence statistic and things like that but these statistics have humans behind them and those humans are victims always. 

I really do hope and I don't see this happening but I hope that in the future whenever the 40% is brought up just like how suicide hotlines are brought up anytime there's talk of suicide that we should also bring up domestic violence resources whenever we bring up domestic violence.

chronically-iconic,"""UK reaffirms commitment to nuclear weapons"" I can't believe we live in a world where it's normal to have a handgun on the temples of every civilian person. I hate how governments continue making massive decisions on behalf of everyone","Just sharing as more of a vent about representational democracy not representing the will of an educated population. 

&gt;Lord Coaker, Minister of State for Defence, was unequivocal in his response. “We are certainly a brave Government, but it has been a consistent policy of whatever Government have been in power to support the nuclear deterrent. The nuclear deterrent will continue; we will renew the nuclear deterrent,” he stated.

It's amazing that the west champions their nuclear weapons programs as something to be revered (or in this case, calling it bravery). There aren't enough nuclear bunkers for everyone, so it's obvious that in the worst case scenario, the wealthiest people and politicians will obviously be spared. It's wonderful (and terrifying) that there's mutual assured destruction to prevent nuclear fallout, but it's nuts that governments will defend the position that capitalism, and representational democracy are so important to defend that they aren't willing to try anything other than using aggressive (offence or defence) tactics. Imagine a world without currency, land ownership, borders, and free trade to make sure we can live harmoniously and share resources. Governments will somehow look at the way they're running the world and tell people it's better this way.

Excittone,Critique of right wing ideologies from a former right-wing person ,"Hey everyone 👋🏽 

Im someone who was formerly on the right but shifted to the left of the political spectrum after reevaluating whether my views would truly be beneficial to society as a whole.  I wouldn't say I am an anarchist but I discovered an anarchist YouTuber ( look up ""What is Politics"" if your interested ) who fundamentally changed my perspective on politics and how people make decisions in groups.

What I found was that, all right-wing ideologies are after heirarchy, control, and authority. No matter which country you focus on, they have the same basic drives. Their desire to dominate others can be in the political, economic, social, or cultural spheres, but all right-wing ideologies tend to want to pool some sort of power or decision-making ability into a small group of people.

I found this to be dramatically opposed to what the left-wing of the political spectrum wants, which is an egalitarian distribution of power and decision making ability and I see anarchism as the true embodiment of freedom and equality for all people.",119,0.94,51,1732787930,Anarchism

Since this is reddit, I'm just going to politely ask, before the infinite critic on why something won't work, maybe just spend sometime investigating why it would. 

DestroyPyramids is proposing to shift from the debate of communism vs capitalism, and instead focus on societal structure: The Pyramid &amp; The Circle. 

What is societal structure? Society functions like a network: Access, Domain, Rights, Privileges, etc. Societal structure is the backbone that societal policy (communism &amp; capitalism) run on. 

[DestroyPyramids.org](http://DestroyPyramids.org) seems to want to provide a vision for humanity to shoot for. The Far Right has their vision. But the far left... isn't so united on anything. Could we all unite to desire to build circular societal structures &amp; destroy societal pyramids while people continue to debate Ism' vs Ism?

For fans of solar punk, the circular structure is a requirement for solar punk to exist. 

I don't think I've posted here before, i'm anticipating the snarky down votes, post removals etc... but hey... even if they're wrong, they're not any more wrong than the people in charge, they're not any less right. 

We need a new vision.

tomsussybi,My anarchist organization has called to vote for the left,"Hi, I am a member of  Union Communiste Libertaire (Libertarian Communist union), a french (and swiss, belgium) anarchist organisation. Last June in France, the president macron dissolved the national assemblé after the Europeans elections after the victory of the extreme right at the European elections. In response to this, the main left parties (Parti Communiste Français, La France Insoumise, Europe Ecologie Les Verts, Parti Socialist) decided to unite in an electoral alliance to prevent the extreme right (the National Rally) from winning and running the country. It is in this context that my organization, the UCL, has called for a vote ""without scruples or illusions"" for the united left. This call had an exceptional character, which called to vote but above all to organize behind, to unionize, to protect themselves and delay the progression of the extreme right through the street. What do you think?

Kir3ji,Capsule Sites: Guerrilla Networks for Digital Activism,"This essay was written in response to those questioning the value of using the state's own artifices as a battleground. Although this essay does not provide a perfect solution, It can hopefully serve as the basis of illuminating discussion.

Although a majority of the internet is commodified and serves to reinforce this paradigm, this is not an intrinsic condition of the internet. But a product of the culture in which the internet was discovered. Though websites like Facebook and eBay will continue to exist, since they serve both as expedients and abstractions of social phenomena already occurring within a culture, their existence does not preclude other designs.

There is nothing stopping someone from establishing an alternative network whose design accounts for different parameters. Our problem is not due to constraints of the medium. Its potential is only confined by the boundaries of our minds. Heinously, mental limits are reinforced by prevailing themes in culture, the existence of shackling symbols, and what Situationists deemed the Spectacle.

It will only be through confronting these artifices that new methods and potentials will emerge. Till we fight far enough, we will unfortunately be fighting blind, but this does not make the fight less noble. Making the conceit that I too am a product of my time, I propose one method of moving forward.

The deployment of capsule sites within corporate space. If a website can be defined as one or more webpages of related content identified by a common domain name, a capsule site is a meta-structure built within the confines of existing domains, though not bound to them, that can be navigated by some means, allowing it to be interfaced with as if it were a website within itself.

The structure is not given shape by a common domain but by the connections between individual nodes. Capsule sites can be built with hyperlinks or hashtags; as long as there is a means of navigating from one node to another, it is possible to launch a capsule site. But how is the structure useful?

Imagine an eco-activist campaign. The goal is to spread awareness of and garner support for legislation protecting the planet. To gain traction, the activists first decide to target three companies with large carbon footprints. They prioritize these social media accounts, not only because of their environmental impact but also because of their large followings. The activists then choose a hashtag for their action campaign. For instance, they choose #GreenToday29.

This is done to connect the nodes to a unique handle, forming a network. They then generate content typical of campaigns of their type — infographics, art, etc. — and deploy them on the target pages. In effect, they have created a campaign website within the social media accounts of these brands, successfully subverting the space while also increasing their cause’s exposure by capitalizing on those brands’s existing audiences.

This guerrilla approach to creating networks using existing domains can be applied to numerous campaigns and projects. Through the intelligent deployment of capsule sites, we can not only succeed in organizing and executing direct action, but also radically reorganize the way we navigate the web.",2,1,0,1732473181,Anarchism
prar83,Starting an Anarchist Reading Group in a small town – advice &amp; experiences,"I’m moving to a small town in the UK soon, and I don’t know anyone there yet. From what I’ve read, the town seems to have a somewhat progressive, left-leaning vibe, which makes me think it could be a good place to start an **offline anarchist reading group**.

Here’s the idea:

The group would collectively decide on a book (related to anarchism, probably non-fiction, but open to the group’s input). We’d meet every week or two for about an hour to discuss a chapter or 50ish pages. It is a slow reading for sure, but this pacing works well because it’s flexible — people can miss a meeting and still jump back in without losing the thread. It usually takes 4–5 meetings to finish a book.

In a previous online group I was part of (the one that got me into anarchism!), we read and discussed works by David Graeber, James C. Scott, Silvia Federici, Frantz Fanon, etc. It was a great experience — not just for engaging with anarchist thought, but also for practicing collective organizing in a small way.

My plan so far is either to post about the group online or maybe put up flyers in spots like pubs, cafes, or record shops with bulletin boards with local events. But I’m also nervous about turnout — either too few people showing up or the wrong kind of attention (someone looking to disrupt).

So, I wanted to reach out here for advice:

Have you run or joined a similar group, either online or offline?

What worked well for you in terms of organizing and outreach?

How did you navigate potential challenges (like low turnout or disruptive participants)?

I’d also love to hear if this post inspires anyone else to start something similar. I think small, local groups like this are a great introduction to anarchist literature and an opportunity to experiment with collective practices.

Thanks in advance for any thoughts or advice!",25,0.95,4,1732481386,Anarchism

Kir3ji,In Defense of Electronic Civil Disobedience ,"There has been some criticism lodged against us. Claims have been made that our activism is merely engagement. That our movement is sort of sofa ersatz activism. However, in order for this argument to hold true, you must make a central conceit. That the concrete world is somehow more real than the digital. Members of The Kollectiv do not view the net from this narrow scope. We see the digital realm as an extension of the more abstract plain of technology. We see the space, though incorporeal on a macroscale, to be very real.

The average user in 2024, spent a 1/5th of their life online. Whether engaging with shopping, posting, or just browsing the net this is a significant portion of time. Enough time is spent on the net that a culture has emerged around various social media sites. Artifacts are made that can only be interacted with in the digital space. And people can become totally enmeshed in a digital world if they wish. Interacting with the greater world almost exclusively in the digital realm. 

An extreme example would be an individual who works as a digital nomad, does all their shopping online, and interacts with others exclusively through social media. Although this individual would be seen to be living a fringe net lifestyle, this way of life is very possible. To argue that activism should not be done through the medium of technology is only alienating. It does not serve one's greater purpose. 64% of the world is online. That is 5.52 billion souls. 

Though The Kollectiv adopts a view of the internet separate from those informed by commodity and corporate interest, the economic activity on the net can’t be ignored. Imagine the disruptive potential of a boycott. The sheer volume of activity allows the activist to make lasting change on the world. We can look back to The Gamestop Short Squeeze. A grassroots political action originating in Wallstreets Bets. To go further back in history we can make reference to the initiatives of net.artists. Groups such as the VNS created works like the “A Cyberfeminist Manifesto for the 21st Century”. Work like this advanced both feminism and digital art. To write off the digital landscape as a lesser landscape of reform, activism, and engaging art, one would have to ignore the efficacy of these movements. 

Going further into the political landscape we can look at the example set by Net Strike. A software that was deployed by activists in the 90’s for digital sit ins. It essentially was a tool for groups to orchestrate DDOS attacks. A vector of protest, that has unfortunately been taken from the general public and is now deployed heinously by state actors to suppress movements. This reversal if anything shows that net activism should be more staunchly defended. The internet is now often the first point of contact individuals have with any movement. And it is also the center of global operations. Are rights on the net should be defended, advanced, and clearly defined. The right to protest should not just extend to the physical space, when the digital space is becoming such a driving factor in our lives.

The Kollectiv’s digital graffiti campaign and its current food disparity initiative is only the beginning. We plan on continuing to mobilize people to be the change they want to see in the world. By establishing our ad hoc hyperlink structure: essentially a website built within the framework of another. We will be raising awareness for our cause. Making people think about the effects of food disparity, while considering new ways to experience the internet. Are either of these aims ignoble? I do not believe so.

 We are continuing in the footsteps of activists such as The Electro Hippies. Advancing methods of protest into the 21st Century. We are also continuing the efforts of situationist thinkers. Now that globalism taken home and the internet has pushed commodity and spectacle into our home. We must attack it at its source if liberty is to continue to flourish and grow for future generations.

 To ignore the possibilities of change now is rob the children of the future of their potential fruit. That is why I continue to call for the development of [net.art](http://net.art/) and methods of activism on the web. Not only to raise awareness for causes affecting us here and now, but to change the landscape of the internet for the people of the future.",26,0.87,0,1732451010,Anarchism
disqersive,I'm looking for thoughts/advice on being an anarchist with cPTSD/OCD/chronic illness,"Hi ya'll.

Do any of you have experiences with growing your anarchist values alongside managing and navigating complex emotional stress/trauma? Anarchism  is my home. The last 4-5 years especially have shown me again and again that it is where I belong, as I've been more radicalized by the state's response to the Covid-19 pandemic.

The thing I wrestle with is my nervous system. Between cPTSD and ongoing chronic illness (suspected Long Covid induced me/cfs and dysautonomia) I have been having a hard fucking time this year trying to practice and actualize some of the more active aspects of how I want to be an anarchist. I have dreams of food rescue and borrowing things, public art and propaganda. My body, however, can't handle some of these things. I get really triggered and my nervous system shuts down, I crash hard and have sensory overwhelm. I was arrested earlier this year defending a college campus encampment and my health has plummeted since.

Currently I am trying to build a solid social circle, which I guess is generally not so easy these days and especially at my age.
What I am often noticing, is that most people have very little time to actually meet.
Everyone is crazily busy with work and in many cases also with kids.
To me, it seems like this is a big problem in western society.
Most people don't have time to get together for fun, let alone to help each other.
Instead, people are getting more and more lonely. Fun (entertainment goods) , but also help (like care for small children or old people), has to be bought, in may cases.

I am very fortunate, to have a job that allows me a lot of free time. But this still doesn't solve those issues on a personal level, when everyone else is super busy.
Oftentimes I am thinking, that it might be best, to befriend unemployd people, as long as they still have a positive attitude towards life.
At least those people would have time to meet regularly.

J4ck13_,Looking for effective responses to state repression &amp; fascism coming from the Trump administration.,"Most of the responses I've seen so far fall into one or more of these categories:

1. Pep talks, which are usually vague and more about motivating people to keep (or start) fighting rather than making suggestions about how to fight.

2. Vague calls to ""organize!"" Ok sure, but organize what?

3. Calls to reform the Democratic party, electoral strategies etc. That's not an issue in this sub but a potential problem that might crop up here are strategies &amp; tactics that are only or mostly of interest to anarchists. Imo the resistance to Trump will have to be much more broad based than just us.

4. Retreatist / prepper strategies and tactics. E.g. people planning to flee or hunker down with supplies etc.

So I'm looking for more than the above 4 things. Any historical precedents of effective resistance to state backed fascism that could apply to the u.s. situation now?

It’s time to fight back - not with fists or fire, but with strategy, wit, and relentless resolve. The battle has begun, and we’ve been sitting idle too long.

No more appeasement. No more hand-wringing and woe is me. That era is over.  

Because now, and you know who I'm referring to when I say it, they’re shouting the quiet part out loud.  We’ve seen this movie already and - SPOILER ALERT - it gets two big fat fucking thumbs down. 

This is an existential crisis - cultural, societal, and moral. No amount of politeness or compromise will fix it. Change must be decisive, sharp, and unrelenting.

We operate under the ethos of “Chaotic Good” — ethically grounded, but willing to bend conventions to achieve a just and necessary outcome. This isn’t about playing fair. It’s about playing to win.

The Plan

We start by undermining their narratives - turning their propaganda into bloated caricatures of itself. Amplify their contradictions, highlight their hypocrisies, and watch as their house of cards teeters. Social media isn’t just a platform; it’s a battlefield. Use it. Inject doubt, expose flaws, and disrupt their echo chambers with precision and intent.

Then, we isolate their safe spaces—their disinformation dens, where they gather to reinforce their delusions. These are the breeding grounds of their smug certainty and obscene bloviation We dismantle them with ridicule, fact, complete situational awareness, unrelenting inspection and unpredictable strategic disruption.

The Offensive

We emerge from the shadows and go on the offensive. Divide and discredit. Target those who thrive on borrowed ideas and hollow convictions. Ridicule, though sharp, is an effective tool—it cuts through their self-assured veneer and forces introspection or isolation.

We laugh. We mock. We hone cruelty to a fine point, and turn it upon to those who would do the the same, only against the defenseless or weak. We use it as a weapon against the arrogance that blinds them.

Their hubris is our opportunity. They’ve grown too comfortable in their echo chambers, where dissent is manufactured and managed, and where doubt is shouted down and dismissed. But echo chambers collapse under pressure. By sowing discord through deception and double agency, we begin to re-shape the narrative and further weaken the tenuous, hierarchical power structure. Decision making slows. Informational logistics become crippled. Mistrust breeds infighting. Infighting breeds collapse.

The Results

History has proven that this works. Figures who seemed untouchable crumble under the weight of their own avarice, narcissism, loyalty-before-competence and confidence-before-evidence. When doubt creeps in, and extrinsic value is foolishly assumed equivalent to its intrinsic counterpart, the inner circle of ""trust"" is breached, and the Laura Loomers of the world must be sacrificed to repair the damage. Ejected, unceremoniously and with malicious intent. It’s a matter of when, not if.

When their backs are against the wall, their true nature will be revealed. They’ll either flee or fight, but either way, they lose. Cowards flee and become the weak, thus high-value prey to their morally bankrupt militant brethren.  They eventually, unavoidably consume themselves,  becoming the ouroboros - the snake which eats itself - and starting the cycle anew.  Starting it under a benevolent but in this case what absolutely must be a highly vigilant new regime. 

The Mission

This isn’t about abandoning moral principles - it’s about weaponizing them. Evidence, facts, wisdom, and truth are our greatest tools. With them, we don’t just dismantle ignorance; we eradicate it.

The stakes are high. The outcome is just. And the time is now.

No mercy for the wicked, justice for the victims, balance and reason back to our society.

Alarming_Maybe,Alternative Practices for US nonprofits,"Hi all:

I have been thinking about non profits in the US and how the typical board-executive director model has been potentially weakened by income inequality (i.e. trustees tend to be retired or hella rich because those are the only people who have money/time these days).

Ironically, many of the most progressive nonprofits are also beholden to the interests of capital, since funding is the number one most important thing. That, simply put, fucking sucks. I've seen too many great leaders sacrifice their integrity and allow certain donors to throw their weight around because they simply relied on their funding too much.

I'm looking for suggestions or places to start with either nonprofits in the US that currently embody more progressive approaches in their institutional structure (e.g. workers councils, profit sharing, etc.) or literature that suggests ways to run a business that embodies more socialist/anarchist values within the capitalist context of the United States.

This could actually start a civil war, we've already had one and it was caused by conflict between state forces over control of a cheap labor pool.   
  
The United States has always relied on labor by an underclass to keep itself running. During the last civil war that was being provided by enslaved people and now it's being provided by undocumented immigrants. Neither party cares about undocumented immigrants as such, and neither cared about the slaves last time. What they do care about is their labor pool and state sovereignty.

If Trump is going to use Red state military forces to invade Blue state territory to eliminate their cheap labor pool, there will be a state on state civil war for the same reasons there was last time. There's already a Blue Confederacy forming, also DNC backed, like the last one.

Just like last time these state forces would be complimented by a coalition of militias and civilian groups on both sides.

1. To remove lead, microplastics, bacteria, and other stuff that may become more and more present

2. Maybe retain the fluoride if possible. Maybe I'll look into figuring out how to add it after if it gets removed.

3. Requires buying the least amount of plastic possible. Preferably without needing to be replaced too often

4. To be used on rain water and tap water. I don't live near any lakes, rivers, or oceans... Yet.

5. Preferably cheap cause I'm not rich. My budget is $50-$100. Maybe willing to pay more cause it is water.

0neDividedbyZer0,Uncovering Chinese Anarchy Part 2: Mohist Activism and Yangzi's Individualism,"Hello again!

This is my second piece to a long history series detailing anarchic and libertarian tendencies in China. In this piece I discuss two very unknown thinkers outside of East Asia - Mozi and Yangzi.

The former was the founder of a rival school to Confucianism, whose members formed a highly disciplined cadre of activists, going so far as to defend cities to the death for their ideals. The Mohists also developed logic, universalism, consequentialism, siege defense, and a concept of Mutual Aid, the ideas of which influence activists and Chinese/East/Southeast Asian mutual aid networks. Some brief comparisons to Sergei Nechayev and an analysis of their praxis follows, with many sources and footnotes for the more curious to follow. 

The latter thinker, Yang Zhu, is a mysterious person who never wrote down his thoughts. However, based upon our circumstantial evidence, it seems he was a genuine individualist, whose ideas radically questioned and rejected the state, one of the first ever in history to do so. His ideas have anachronistically been labeled Daoist, and he almost certainly influenced Zhuangzi. I do a comparison with his ideas to Stirner and settle the possibility of his influence upon Stirner (no influence it appears). This then is the latest comparison of Egoist and Yangist thought that may be of interest to Anarchists today. 

The influence of these two figures is hard to convey given how unknown they are, but many of the anarchic tendencies we eventually see in Confucianism and Daoism originate in these two thinkers. 

The next piece in the series will dive into Daoism, the Daodejing, Ursula K. Le Guin's bastardized translation of it, and analyzing how ""anarchist"" the Daodejing actually is. 

I would appreciate a read and would love to answer any questions people have.

arcowank,Testimonies from kaiāwhina (mutual aid volunteers) about cops at the recent nationwide Toitū Te Tiriti hīkoi/protest in Aotearoa New Zealand,"""Just seeing a few other people comment about the cops. The team around us at Group 5 during the actual hīkoi were great. They were all Māori and their chief spoke to me early on and said that we (Kaiāwhina and the Māori wardens) had the authority here and that they would just give us back up if anything got out of hand but that they weren’t expecting that at all. They were really respectful and hands-off. Every now and then the chief would ask me if I’d got a second and give me an update from his comms about where things were getting blocked once people had moved out of our area etc. They were great to work alongside. It was really refreshing and exactly the kind of police you’d want at a hīkoi if you have to have them there at all.



""I saw a beautiful moment with the police chief and a tamariki Māori \[Māori child\] about 4 years old. His mum had come and asked if the kid could shake the cop’s hand. The cop took off his hat, got down on his knees, had a hongi with the tamariki, shook his hand and gave him a high-five. The little boy was all lit up and the cop was really moved and thanked the mum. More of this kind of policing please!""



""I saw one Maori wahine \[Māori woman\] police officer and a Maori warden helping a young Maori wahine over the bridge, the youngster was a bit distraught, not unwell, maybe a bit overcome with emotion. I asked the Maori Warden and Wahine Maori officer with her if I could assist the distraught young person, too. The police officer said, ' kao Papa, we okay, we going to walk our friend to Curran St, we will be okay, she will be okay.'

Idk about collective vs individual, I'm going to say communitarian individual for the sake of this. 

The opposite would be authoritarian, capitalist (maybe state capitalism), reactionary (""upholding status quo's traditions""), conservative, and nationalist. (Probably collective too)

Fascism is all of the above except it doesn't ""uphold the status quo's traditions/hierarchy"" although it has some of its own. And it tends to be corporatist and not capitalist.

Monarchism on the other hand is the opposite on those axes, but people say fascism is the opposite.

filthyhippie76,Seeking Community Input- A Prediction and Scenario for Analysis,"Here's what I foresee coming and a big question for us all. J20 will arrive. There may or may not be massive mobilizations by then, most likely not IMO given the current silence in the streets. In either case, Trump will hit the ground running, hard. It is absolutely clear at this point that the first targets will likely be immigrant communities; I would imagine that he has been planning the massive promised community raids for quite awhile now (2018 family separation was already being piloted secretly in 2017) and will be quite capable in deploying federal, state, local, and possibly paramilitary forces into the streets to shock and awe and confuse and terrorize. I also foresee spectacular shutdowns at the border, perhaps in combination with a spectacular migrant ""crisis"" (DHS has been stage-managing the border for awhile now IMO.)Left and community forces will likely intervene to counter these raids on the ground which, combined with likely police brutality at anti-Trump and pro-Palestine actions, will likely lead to a spiral of spectacular violence. This will then give Trump the excuse he needs to begin spectacular crackdowns on opposition. Beyond the legal apparatus- outlawing ""antifa"" as a domestic terrorist ""organization,"" reviving criminal anarchy statutes, immunizing vigilante violence, and deploying the Insurrection Act (including suspension of habeas corpus)- Trump can respond in both bold and subtle ways. Subtly, he will deploy the security agency apparatuses to surgically dismember the already weak/nonexistent resistance. Spectacularly, he will likely IMO launch a massacre at some point- government forces firing into a crowd, Kent State on a massive scale. At which point, I predict all overt resistance will be finished for quite awhile and he can begin his crusading fascist transformation of society while simultaneously dismantling the official opposition in the Democrats. This could all happen in a matter of a couple weeks IMO (the Palestinian encampment spectacle barely lasted three months.)My questions to the community are the following. How likely do you see this scenario? What might be different? And most importantly, how do we not fall into these traps? How do we resist overtly without falling into a crushing response of violence and repression? How do we resist subtly without being marginalized and dismembered in the shadows? How do we visibly connect and grow with the masses ready for leadership under these harsh conditions? Can we avoid moving to underground and armed resistance at this point?

P.S. The recent Crimethinc post about assemblies on this subreddit got me thinking, too.  Is a strategy of bottom up rapid, public, democratic mobilization a viable counter-strategy in the current conjuncture?  What might that look like right now in the U.S.?  We saw attempts at this in 2017 with neighborhood assemblies, etc. with mixed to negative results.  What went right, what went wrong then?

Yeah im going to be an impolite uppity cripple.

You want to resist the state? Wear a mask.

You want to physically protect yourself and your community members? Wear a mask.

You want to be in solidarity with vulnerable populations, including the disabled? Wear. a. mask.

This isnt moral performing or some kind of conspiratorial distraction from other issues or whatever (which i have been accused of. sorry for wanting my life to be valued and included in organizing! so sorry!) . Im writing this because its important to me, because disabled grief and rage should be heard, and im sick honestly, not only physically as a cripple but mentally of seeing a majority of the people who claim to be against the right and against physical violence to minority groups willingly enact it every fucking day. The amount of ableism among the left is buck fucking wild. But its because undoing our oppressive mindsets takes active work and effort. Labeling ourself left does not absolve any of us of the white supremacist mindsets we all have to undo.

And i wonder if part of it is because being covid cautious isnt glorious; it is tiring, it is exhausting, it is something you have to commit to thinking about and showing up for. It isnt one beautiful act of revolution. It becomes a daily part of your life. It is a responsibility. You get no immediate reward. Can you handle that? can you actually, really handle that and do it? can you try? or will we continue to leave the oppressed to handle their oppression on their own, reinforcing the individualist mindset that atomizes us further and facilitates mass death?

Covid denial, anti-masking, anti-vaxxing has been an ostensibly right wing politic from the start. But somehow its all okay now. Because we all want to go back to ""normal"". Well this isnt normal. Kids going back to school and spreading covid isnt normal. People (including children) developing [long term incurable disease](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-022-00846-2) from repeated infection isnt normal. Deciding that a body ravaging disease is ""here to stay"" and yet not using or implementing (even at LEAST publicly, like in hospitals, schools, grocery...) [\*any\* of the tools we know work and have to combat it](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7027e1.htm) is not normal. (its like saying ""HIV is here to stay"" and then not using any protection, denying any science or education about it, not getting tested, and for the sake of argument the only vaccines are ones that still allow it to spread. does that make any actual sense to you?)

Your cognitive dissonance will not save you from the work that needs to be done. You could be doing something to change your immediate environment and challenge violence and eugenics \*right now\*. If you arent, why? What will it take to get leftists to take this shit seriously and continue to speak up about it? No where has any science in all of the global community said ""covid is over"". The person who declared that was Biden. Are you going to take your fucking advice from the guy who caught it like five fucking times and has ostensible cognitive and physical decline? Sure, you could say ""hes just old"", but we know enough about how long covid affects people of all ages that it is not out of the realm of possibility **at all** to say that thats at least part of why hes so sick now.

TLDR: Covid isnt over. Covid denial is a right wing politic. When you dont wear a mask and do what you can to fight this disease, you are complicit in eugenics. Disabled people should not have to stay inside and live in fear, because no one wants to do their part in being \*collectively\* responsible for communicable disease. **Get curious, be brave, start these conversations with your leftist groups**, and [***Wear a fucking mask.***](https://cleanairoly.org/maskzine/HowToChooseAMaskEZine.pdf)

[deleted],So should we prepare for a massive civil war under the Trump administration? What do you think is going to look like? I'm imagining some return of the occupy movement with far more intensity,"Alright, I’m really curious to hear from y’all: how likely do you think it is that we’d see a civil war if Trump gets a second term? It feels like everything is just more tense and divided than ever, and a lot of people seem to think things could actually get violent. What do you think? Here are some reasons why it might happen…and why it might not.

Why a Civil War Could Actually Happen:

1. Intense Political Divisions: We’re seeing deeper rifts than we’ve had in a long time. A Trump comeback would probably push those divides even further. Issues like immigration, gun control, and voting rights already have people on edge. With Trump back in the White House, it’s hard to say how much worse things could get.


2. Rise of Armed Groups and Radicalization: Let’s be real—militias and far-right groups have gotten way more organized and vocal. If Trump’s back, these groups might feel empowered and ready to act. There’s a risk they’d see opposition as a threat and respond with force.


3. Economic Pressures: The economy is already rough for a lot of people, and it doesn’t seem to be getting better anytime soon. Another Trump term could bring more instability. If people feel like they’re being pushed out of the economy or losing their jobs, that frustration could boil over.


4. Loss of Trust in Institutions: There’s already so much distrust in institutions, from the FBI to the courts. If people see the government as illegitimate or “out to get them,” we could see more groups taking things into their own hands.



Why We Might Avoid It:

1. Lack of Organized Movement: While there’s a ton of division, there isn’t really a clear or unified movement on either side. People are angry, but without some kind of structured leadership or purpose, it’s hard to imagine a full-scale civil war breaking out.


2. People Like Stability: Even those who are fed up with the system still depend on it for basic things. Whether it’s job security, paying bills, or just the routines of everyday life, a lot of people don’t want to risk that for the unknown.


3. Government Crackdown on Dissent: The government has a huge police force, the National Guard, and other ways to shut things down quickly. If it comes to it, they’ve got the power to put out fires before they spread.



Would the Military Split?

Could the military fracture in all this? It’s possible. A lot of soldiers have personal beliefs and backgrounds that could influence them if things got bad. Here are a few reasons why the military might not stay united:

Political Divides: Some in the ranks might feel loyalty to Trump, while others might not. If Trump has strong support in the military, it could create splits between those who’d follow him directly and those who’d follow orders from higher up.

Personal Ethics: If things got messy and soldiers were ordered to act against civilians, some might refuse on moral grounds. They may feel like they’re caught between duty and their conscience.

Community Ties: A lot of soldiers are deeply connected to their home communities. If things get chaotic back home, they might feel torn between military orders and staying loyal to where they came from.


What do you think? Is there a real chance of things going this far, or are we too dependent on the current system to let it all go up in flames?

MutedShenanigans,"Questions about genocide, fascism and collective responsibility","I've been thinking about this over the past week or so and I'm wondering if I'm offbase. Please let me know if you think so.

A genocide, say the Holocaust or the Palestinian Genocide, is more than merely one group of people annihilating another. It is a mark against all humanity that we collectively let it happen. By recognizing it as a genocide, we say, ""it is a stain against humanity that this occurred, and we all share the burden of never allowing it to happen again."" Even though I did not support Israel personally, what did I do to, exactly, to stop it? Couldn't we all have done more? Shouldn't we continue to do all we can?

I feel that now that so many people who were alive during the Holocaust are now dead, our collective memory no longer carries the weight of just how colossally evil it was. Many folks, even if they recognize it as such, may simply hold the Germans entirely responsible, or perhaps the rest of Europe for allowing it to happen too. But I firmly believe it remains a yoke upon all people, no matter their direct role in it. By saying it was just this or that group's fault, we diminish it and weaken our ability to prevent it happening again.

I have also come to think of a country's descent into fascist dictatorship the same way. No, I don't blame the people of Tonga for helping put a fascist into office on the other side of the planet. But is it not a stain on all humanity when this happens? Is it not a reflection of the worst of all we are? And should it not be an equal warning to all mankind to resist the twin evils of greed and apathy, under which almost all evils devised by people could be categorized?

I look at the left blaming the DNC and liberals for Trump's victory, and Dems blaming pretty much everyone. But this was a collective loss: it is to the detriment of the entire human race and therefore we must all shoulder responsibility, reflect on how we let things get to this point, and ask ourselves how we can eliminate fascist tendencies root and stem. We owe it to future generations to take this responsibility.

I regret that I have waited so long in my life to commit to mutual aid and strengthening ties to our local community. I hope current events help snap many others out of their apathy or nihilism, and commit to helping others and bringing happiness to those around them.

Since 1945, the republicans where mostly silent on what they did in the middle eas or in other countries that where not of america interest.

Also a lot of terrible people also are justifying their bigotry that they held in for so long, because of the economic decline and far-right in power. I see similarities to nazi Germany. In my opinon since 1945 the people in a west turned a blind eye on far-right, because they thought fascism would never happen and resurface of more hateful far-right is impossible.

You can get a better idea of what's going on around you and what other anarchists are doing. Depending on where you live, it's gonna take more research on your part.

In this part I'll go over things to start. Maybe you don't want to join an existing group, maybe you want to do something till you find them, maybe there are no groups in your area. This is for you.

 Hopefully you'll find something useful in here, take what is interesting to you and feel free to ignore the rest. If any of the links peak your interest then dig around the website a little. They are resources to be used. 

 There is an actual loosely connected international anarchist movement. It is very defuse in most places, but you can try to connect with local groups or organizations or you can do your own thing. This list is assuming you are in the US, if not some of the ideas/links will still be useful.  

-Write letters to political prisoners/prisoner support- 

This page has a ton of resources on how to get started writing to/supporting prisoners. I recommend starting with the NYC Anarchist Black Cross guide to writing letters. 

https://uprisingsupport.org/further-resources/ 

The uprising support site has a list of prisoners from 2020, the NYC ABC site has mostly longer term political prisoners and there are other groups as well. 

 There are also many different directions you can take prisoner support. Books through Bars is great!

https://prisonbookprogram.org/prisonbooknetwork/

-Start a phone tree to respond to ICE raids-

 This must be done carefully and with a strong understanding of what is being asked, but if your community is affected by raids or has reason to believe that you will be it's better to have those conversations now.

-Support the International Anti-Fascist Defense Fund-

Buy a T-shirt, set up a benefit show, tell your friends about it. Find a way to support that works for you. They do good work and if you donate you get all the annoying emails where people hash out minute details of who gets support from the fund. Hahaha.

https://intlantifadefence.wordpress.com/

-Translation/transcription/Interpretation work-

Many groups struggle to organize in multiple languages and this is vital, especially for crossing class boundaries and international borders. Reach out to anarchist groups that you appreciate and offer what you can. Translate texts with your friends and post them online!

Getting solid info from anarchist groups across the globe is great.

Multiple anarchist libraries are looking for help getting off the ground or expanding their text selections.

https://theanarchistlibrary.org/special/index

-Table local shows-

 Take those zines we talked about in part 2. Get a table. Go to a show (ask permission first if needed) put zines on to the table and talk to people about them. Curate the table to make sense for the situation.

-Volunteer at your local anarchist bookstore-

Do you live in/near a city? There is a decent chance there is a radical bookstore there. They frequently have volunteering opportunities. You can learn how a collective works and all the boring details people leave out. Here are a few. 

 Philadelphia  https://woodenshoebooks.org/ Seattle  https://leftbankbooks.com/ Baltimore  https://redemmas.org/ Vancouver BC https://spartacusbooks.net/

-Put up posters, make art, stickers, banners, etc-

-Learn how to research your local fash/pigs-

The fascist movement has shifted focus pretty hard the last 4 years. While we might end up with PBs back in the street soon, most likely fash will continue to be organizing at school board meetings, anti-homeless groups, in police departments and the republican party. We have done a good job spreading antifash cultural signifiers, but not practices as the far right street movement was defeated.

StudentOfSociology,"New article on Tribal Broadband Bootcamps: Indian Country faces digital divide by creating their own ISPs, fighting for their own digital sovereignty","This Nov. 8 [article](https://www.dailydot.com/news/digital-divide-indigenous-indian-country/) at the *Daily Dot* is a look at the latest Tribal Broadband Bootcamp taking on the digital divide that's undercutting internet access on tribal lands. Importantly, they're doing it in an autonomy-focused way that should interest anarchists. In particular, the section of this article titled *Changing the whole framework* discusses the shift in Indian Country from enforced dependency on the U.S. federal government to a home rule, tribal digital sovereignty perspective. Against the backdrop of longstanding, ongoing injustices against Indigenous people, this article discusses what improved internet access on tribal lands might mean as the grass-touching, mutual aid-style bootcamps meet the selfie-driven, AI spam-clogged dystopia of today's internet.

[deleted],Global mutual aid platform,"I'm honestly frustrated that, in an era where we have apps to find people for casual sex or to sell secondhand items, we still don’t have a widely accessible global platform for mutual aid (not just for money), something where people can connect locally and offer or receive support for essential needs of all kinds. (Plus, the low engagement and interest to push ideas like that, while some stupid leftist memes online get 2k engagement and likes.)

We have the technology for instant connections, yet no coordinated platform for the working class, disabled individuals, or anyone needing assistance with daily problems people face. Imagine if there was an app that made it as easy to find a volunteer for grocery shopping, help with transportation, or skill-sharing as it is to find a used couch or a date. Instead, we have communities full of people needing support and others willing to offer it, but no accessible way to bring them together.

Some might argue that funding such a platform would be the main challenge, but I’m not convinced that’s the biggest issue. We see individuals crowdfunding significant amounts of money on platforms like GoFundMe all the time. Plus, with the collective strength of leftist communities, crowdfunding and mutual aid for setup and upkeep costs (like server hosting) would be achievable if the right people coordinated it.

What we really need is for IT professionals who are committed to mutual aid to offer their skills voluntarily to put this idea into practice and I refusd to believe there are no leftist ITers out there (in particular cause so many people in IT will do random projects to boost their portfolio). 

1. Backend Developer/DevOps - Luckily, we already have someone for this role who can handle the server, databases, and other infrastructure.
2. Frontend Developer - To build a responsive and accessible interface for web and mobile.
3. UI/UX Designer - To make the platform intuitive, inclusive, and welcoming for all users.
4. QA Tester - To ensure everything functions well across devices and meets accessibility standards.

Beyond tech skills, we’d need people dedicated to keeping the platform financially sustainable and accessible. Ideally, we’d have folks committed to organizing mutual aid and gathering ongoing resources to help with monthly maintenance, like server costs, and finding volunteers for outreach /advertising the platform. 

Political ideologies are hollow if they don’t translate into practical action, and I truly believe that if we had an easy way to connect, thousands of people would be eager to offer time, resources, or skills for their communities. Yes, grassroots organizing through local groups is vital, but let’s be real, many community orgs struggle to meet the needs of all members, especially disabled and low-income folks. Many don’t even provide basic accommodations, like masking, which excludes some people from even participating.

So, if you're a leftist IT professional or just someone with resources or passion for mutual aid, let’s make this happen. Reach out to me, and let’s talk about building a platform that can truly bring mutual aid into our communities in a sustainable, accessible way. 

(And yes I understand ""it is all not THAT easy"", but nothing about our lives is ""easy"". That should not be used as an argument to avoid helping eachother).

Zines. Anarchists love zines. Little foldable essays that are easy to print and pass around. Leave them on the table at the cool coffee shop, in the little lending libraries, table a local show, throw a zine fair, crash a block party, you can even make your own.

So I have nothing to say about last night that hasn’t been said a million times already. But if we assume that the State won’t ever help us again, and that any and all projects to work with it are a waste of time, what will you do when any mutual aid project that seeks to offer an alternative to it is criminalized? When the police, army, or just bands of armed thugs with a presidential pardon in their back pocket break absolutely everything that anyone tries to build against them? People talk about building some mutual aid alternative to capitalism as if fascists won’t seek to sterilize even the first sign of it. They got almost everything they wanted last night, they already had far more guns than anyone sympathetic to us, and to that arsenal they have now added the most powerful military force in human history. There is no low they will not stoop to, no blood they will not shed - nothing that we can hope to believe they won’t try.

I don’t believe this is the end of the world, or that it’s all doomed. But this is nightfall. And night may last a very, very long time. Certainly long enough that none alive today will see any dawn.

Stockjock1,This is my grandfather...,"This was my grandfather.

He was an immigrant from Greece, who \*legally\* migrated to the USA.  He learned how to read and write in English.  He found an American sponsor somehow (there was no internet back then and I doubt he even had telephone service in that small village in Greece.)

Once he was admitted, he joined the United States Army.  After his military service, he got married and had 4 children, including my mother (RIP).  Life was hard, but he worked hard and persevered.  He busted his butt in the copper mines.  He bought a home in Montana.  When his health deteriorated, he bought a home in Los Angeles and moved to L.A.  He was never on welfare.  He did not expect handouts.  He never broke the law and was never arrested.  Had he been refused entry, he would not have entered illegally, but rather, would have remained in Greece and lived the best life that he could.

That is how you do it, in my view.  You don't hop a fence, enter illegally, and demand special privileges.

P.S. Someone asked me what AI I used to ""create"" the photo.  I had used the AI on a DNA/Heritage website to add a bit of color to it.  But since the question was raised, I'll delete that photo and instead upload the unedited original photo, which is surprisingly sharp for that era.

The reasons why they lost are obvious, but the DNC seems perfectly willing to just dig their head in the sand and pretend like doubling-down will fix the issues. I doubt the Democrat Party will turn the decade at the current rate they're going. Which means that the Republican Party needs to start preparing to live in a world without the Democrat Party. We might experience a period similar to the ""Era of Good Feelings."" Our system naturally favors two parties, so a new party will likely fill the spot of the DNC eventually. Republicans need to spend the meantime preparing for that world because sectionalism within the party is absolutely absurd and is already damaging the party's ability to get stuff done. The Republican Party needs to actually decide their values and double-down on them. (For example, gun rights and abortion).

I'm begging, save my state from the devil, his political pons doing his work.

I guarantee it's so bad here politicians and government officials will flee the country instantly to avoid major prison time when a light on where all the money in this state has been going for the last 20 years.

Easy 50% of our states government resigns,  runs, asks for a plea deal. Government contractors same thing, all of them need to be arrested and put on trail. You wanna curb inflation? Cancle all the illegal government spending and taxes in California.

olyrobb,The Tale of the Powerless Party,"
In the land of red, white, and blue,
A tale unfolds that’s sad but true.
The Democrats, once bold and grand,
Now find themselves without command.

As Trump parades his newfound might,
They watch, they fret, both day and night.
Their strategies seem pale and weak,
Their voices soft when they should speak.

In chambers where decisions brew,
Their influence is scant and few.
They plot, they plan, they scheme, they try,
Yet power slips and hopes run dry.

“Oh, what to do?” they often say,
As policies are swept away.
They rally, protest, pen their pleas,
But find no cure for this disease.

For in this game of thrones and power,
They face a most tumultuous hour.
To find their strength, regain their say,
Or watch their influence decay.

So here’s a lesson, clear and stark,
In politics, one must embark
With unity, a steadfast crew,
Lest power fades, and woes ensue.",5,0.56,1,1739758853,Conservative
sleepinglucid,As a Fed I hope DOGE can empower supervisory roles to do their job.,"I'm sure Fednews will put me on a hitlist for saying this, but federal employees are way too insulated. One of the consistant things I've heard in my 6 years as a Fed is ""I will never go supervisor"" for me,  I've always felt the same because they have zero control over their employees. You cannot fire underperformed and there are very few things you can do to incentives your best workers. 

Besides cutting the fat dead weight,  I dream of a GS13 Supervisor than do more then ask a bunch of 7s - 10s to work harder and do better or else..  (nothing no consequences).

Unlucky-Prize,America First Legal: “FEDERAL JUDGE McCONNELL MUST RECUSE HIMSELF IMMEDIATELY”,"TLDR: Judge McConnell has been heavily associated with a non profit that has gotten over 100m of govt funding, including as chair of the board very recently. Therefore his impartiality can be challenged and he should recuse.

https://x.com/America1stLegal/status/1891226933481877590

As many of you may recall, judge McConnell issued a TRO broadly prohibiting the government from freezing spending(i believe it was originally from some OPM memo that they reversed before the TRO), then found the Trump admin wasn’t obeying the order:

https://apnews.com/article/funding-freeze-trump-federal-grants-loans-judge-ec9bf2700c41ec0ba4085d375599d295

This is the one where to comply, the govt would have to get preapproval for a broad range of cuts before doing them. Absurd. 

I for one think the TRO or a RO after it will all get tossed either by the judge or on appeal, but it seems he has a credible conflict as outlined by am first legal in the thread, so perhaps he will recuse himself shortly. 

Per am first legal: Federal law, 28 U.S.C. § 455, requires judges to disqualify themselves “in any proceeding in which [their] impartiality might reasonably be questioned.”

It seems like it can reasonably be questioned at this point. 

My understanding is that if a judge declines to recuse, that can be appealed and there’s also a judge-run panel for alleged misconduct that can be leveraged. Congress could also impeach but that’s very far down the road and probably would follow in a case where on appeal the finding was extra scathing. In this case I doubt he’s ruling this way for his non profit but it doesn’t look good so I think he should recuse. I do think the left venue shopped to get him knowing he’d be sympathetic.

Legal_Ad5412,Conservative Professor - how should science work?,"I’m a research professor in STEM at a top American university. I would consider myself to lean conservative though I never had much interest in politics. I grew up in a very small rural town, but half my family are NY liberals, so I grew bored of the constant inane arguing between people who agree about nearly everything important. I’m posting here because I’m interested in what you all think about hard science. Not anything cultural, I’m talking microbiology, physics, applied math, neuroscience, etc. 

Over the long term, basic science conducted at universities and funded by various governments (mostly Germany, the UK, and more recently the US) has been by far the single largest driver of ever increasing prosperity. This is an indisputable fact, consider everything from antibiotics to nuclear power to computers. Basic science is also key to maintaining a powerful military. Private enterprise cannot and never has supported true basic science for two reasons. 

* First, too much risk with too long of a time horizon. Investment in basic science is far more risky than even venture capital, and new ideas often take longer than a human life to generate profit. Thus it requires capital reserves and stability that only the strongest of governments possess.  
* Second, it is difficult to assign ownership. Important leaps forward that ultimately result in new families of technology are built on free discourse and public access to other scientist’s research. This makes it impossible for a private enterprise to both be productive in research and maintain IP long term.

How do you address these problems in a conservative framework? Many of my colleagues are of the opinion that Trump / DOGE will be a disaster for science, but I’m not sure. What do you think they’re trying to achieve? I know many people who work at NIH / NSF / DOE (the agencies providing most of the research money), and they are confused by emails about DEI policy when that's never been something they think about. Many of us are worried that cuts and chaos in research will harm the country in the long term by destroying the lead we have in science and technology. I appreciate any thoughts.

SurveyMelodic,What is liberal? And where does that put MAGA?,"This isn’t a shit post. I read a lot of political philosophy on my own and want to hear this community’s perspective in particular. 

From my understanding. Liberalism/ liberal democracy includes the values of life, liberty, property, individualism, markets, merit etc. basically, “western values”. Wouldn’t that make democrats, republicans, and libertarians liberals? They all believe those values, so are conservatives and libertarians right wing liberals?

So when MAGA says they’re illiberal, does that mean they’re not Democrats, our not within the liberal democratic order? Answering the first or second have different answers.

Where do moderate conservatives fit in? They’re leftish of MAGA but are they “liberal” in the sense people use it?

What does this mean for the radical left? They get lumped in with liberals all the time but they don’t value private property, or individualism. They’re outside the liberal democratic order in a far left sense. Correct?

CartridgeCrusader23,Let’s talk about WFH,"This subreddit seems to be one of the few places on Reddit where I can voice a dissenting opinion without being banned, so I want to bring this topic into discussion. The Republican and conservative party has taken a hardline stance against remote work, opposing it even for roles that are perfectly suited for a work-from-home model.

Having worked from home for three years has been one of the best changes in my life. I work in tech, where the majority of my tasks are completed from a computer—often by remotely accessing servers or helping colleagues who are also working from home. There is nothing I can't do just as well or even better at home versus in the office. Remote work has dramatically improved my work-life balance, allowed me to spend more time with my wife, and helped me find a healthy balance between my career and personal life.

Of course, some jobs simply cannot be done remotely. But every time I see people rallying against remote work, it feels like their opposition comes from a place of resentment or misunderstanding. Many of these critics seem to have no idea what remote workers actually do. Their arguments often boil down to: *“I had to suffer in an office, so everyone else should too.*”

I fail to see a single valid reason to deny someone the ability to work from home if their job can be performed remotely and they are doing it successfully. Sure, there will always be a few people who abuse remote work, but punishing the entire workforce for the actions of a few is shortsighted and counterproductive.

This anti-remote-work stance reminds me of other losing cultural battles conservatives have fought—like opposition to [marijuana legalization ](https://news.gallup.com/poll/323582/support-legal-marijuana-inches-new-high.aspx)or [gay marriage](https://news.gallup.com/poll/350486/record-high-support-same-sex-marriage.aspx). Whether one agrees or disagrees with those issues morally, the reality is that the vast majority of Americans support them and the average American doesn't seem to[ oppose working from home](https://www.vox.com/recode/22576811/remote-work-survey-data-for-progress-democrats-republicans-approval) either. Opposition to these issues will cost the conservative movement significant support among younger voters and white collar workers. 

The conservative movement has actually done a fantastic job of regaining control over the cultural zeitgeist over the last four years—a space the left dominated for what seems like forever. The reason I believe the left lost ground is because they fixated on issues that the average American simply doesn’t care about. From pushing transgender ideology , forcing LGBT narratives onto the entire country or generally pandering to small minorities over the broader public, they alienated everyday people and drove voters into the conservative camp.

However, if conservatives continue their blanket opposition to remote work, they risk falling into the same trap—alienating voters over an issue that directly affects their quality of life. Younger generations deeply value work-life balance and flexibility. By positioning themselves as the party of “butts in seats” rather than productivity and freedom, conservatives are not only driving away a key demographic but also jeopardizing their hard-won gains in the broader cultural conversation.

If conservatives want to maintain their momentum in the ongoing culture war, they need to pick their battles more wisely. Remote work isn’t a threat to conservative values—it’s an opportunity to champion personal freedom, individual responsibility, and results over rigid rules.",2479,0.89,1237,1739734680,Conservative

I do think a post debate thread allowing conservatives to voice their opinions without being drown out by the left is also reasonable. 

Reddit leftists far outnumber the right. Many on the right refuse to use reddit.

I would like to suggest a follow up thread for flaired conservatives to discuss it after. If people don't engage we could scrap it. I do think it will help though considering the left so easily drowns out the right in our own community.

Antjel_1,Question Regarding Budget,"Question for the community

Is there a way to see the US budget by dept/division/agency?

I think it would be great to see a list of every grouping the dollar amount and a 1-2 liner what they do.

I see Elon working fast but I would love to see this first before making changes so quickly.

Then we as a community can track a running total of the cuts and list as a community any pros/cons to those cuts.

For example USAID is about 30-40billion a year.  Which is a decent chunk but a lot of everything else is pretty small so far.   It will all add up in the end but if we started a thread dedicated to keeping track it would be really cool and allow us to discuss and share thoughts on the risk of cutting a program vs the value.

Redundancies and programs that are bloated and running terrible will be the easy ones but USAID at least for me I'm a little mixed on because I'm not entirely sure how long term that will impact our foreign relations and strategic allies.  This is where great discussions on reform vs cut and how potential reform could realistically be implemented.

I have seen some stuff where China is already jumping in to posture they will be the replacement for USAID which in turn could weaken our global presence and allies.   

Would love to hear everyone else's thoughts on this.

We know we got to make the cuts and get back to a surplus.  I just would like to understand the process and how we are deciding it better.   

Elon is from the tech mindset when you have what we call in the industry technical debt sometimes the easiest way is to just turn it off, see what breaks and then turn it back on later if you have to.  That works sometimes with a company, you may lose some customers or valuable employees but in government we could be leaving ourselves open to global moves that weaken us long term but look like a win in the short term.

If there is already a thread on this please link.  This was just in my head this morning and with stuff moving so fast it would be great to see the facts of what is actually happening consolidated.",4,0.75,3,1739558712,Conservative

ObjectiveJackfruit35,Serious question: Where else is there to go?,"The direction that Reddit has taken the past few months has been really awful. Nearly every sub that I visit has been completely astroturfed to oblivion. Things that I once enjoyed are now overtaken by posts from sad and miserable Left leaning individuals.

This site no longer brings me any joy.

Is there any other social media alternative where I can get my fix of what this website used to be about? I remember the days when people would actually post interesting things and I used to learn so much about life and its intricacies.

I'm tired of the astroturfing and the brigading. I'm tired of the overwhelming collective of this website being opposed to innovation and change. I'm tired of being surrounded by people who want to blame others for their problems instead of championing their own life. I'm tired of presenting facts and being downvoted to oblivion to the point where I no longer have any incentive to contribute different ideas on this website.

We all have so little free time to ourselves outside of our obligations and I'm tired of spending it on this miserable platform. It's like the Left is trying desperately to bring me down to their level and have me as miserable and sad as they are. Misery loves company as they say.

I miss the old Reddit so much. Where else is there to go?

Edit: Someone falsely reported my post as self-harm or suicide and I got the Reddit cares message.

Edit 2: Let me give you an example. This is from r/gaming. Now I know what you're thinking, how could a video game sub possibly post anything through video games that feeds into the Left rhetoric? Well, behold:

Perfectsaturn47,How to Work with Liberals?,"Hi everyone, this is my first time posting in this subreddit, and I'm looking for some advice. I'm trying to navigate managing my Republican views in a very left-leaning company with liberal colleagues. I really enjoy my work, and my coworkers are great overall. I’ve always been aware of their left-leaning perspectives.

I’ve been with this company for three years, and I haven’t had many issues—just a few debates over gun laws with two very liberal coworkers who have since left my work area. However, recent events, like an ICE raid in our city and the ongoing discussions surrounding Trump’s downsizing, have led to more political talk at work. It's especially prominent because I work in research, and with the recent controversies around NIH funding and RFK Jr. being head of HHS these topics are now part of conversations.

To be upfront, I’m not sure if I agree with cutting NIH funding, especially because my job is funded through grants that come from these sources, and the cancer research I do offers vital treatment options where there are currently very few. However, I do agree there is a lot of wasteful government spending, as highlighted by figures like Elon Musk and his DOGE team. But the prospect of cuts to NIH funding is concerning, even for me. I voted for Trump and trust his leadership, but I can’t fully get behind everything that’s being proposed in these areas and maybe it's because I don't fully understand what's happening. 

Regarding my coworkers, I feel outnumbered and a bit isolated because I don’t share their views. For instance, during a coffee break today, the conversation turned to how disgusted everyone was with Trump’s actions, and I found myself just sitting there quietly, scrolling on my phone. I’m not an expert on politics or policies, so I don’t feel confident enough to voice a different opinion, but I also don’t want to feel like I have to sit alone during lab lunches or morning coffee hangouts. I know as time goes on, more of these conversations will come up, and I’m not sure how to handle them without feeling like I have to withdraw from group events altogether.

Any advice on how to manage these situations without feeling out of place would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance!

The other day some frantic yoga lady with an out of control husky came bustling into the bar, looks at everyone, and asks “so anyone else want to talk about how the world is ending?”. Not one person bit, even a couple I suspect are diehard dems. 

She doubled down and said “seriously with everything going on nobody wants to bitch about it?!” And people stood up and walked away. Others looked down at the ground awkwardly. She left soon after.

It's eery to me how closely  this mirrors concerns about today's increasingly visible ""administrative [deep] state"" and media influence.

""Why you fool, it's the educated reader who CAN be gulled. All our difficulty comes with the others. When did you meet a workman who believes the papers? He takes it for granted that they're all propaganda and skips the leading articles. He buys his paper for the football results and the little paragraphs about girls falling out of windows and corpses found in Mayfair flats. He is our problem. We have to recondition him. But the educated public, the people who read the high-brow weeklies, don't need reconditioning. They're all right already. They'll believe anything.""  
- C.S. Lewis

An article from World News Group delves into this topic, exploring how discernment and critical thinking are essential in an era where the administrative state and media conglomerates hold substantial sway over public perception.

My grandparents are super democrat by the way and hate the fact that I’m a black conservative, they can’t wrap their heads around it. When we met with the my grandparents, they asked if we’ve really thought this through. We said yes. They then said marriage is already really hard and with us being an interracial couple, it’s going to be wayyyy harder (???) then they start asking my fiancée if his family is racist and if they have an issue with him marrying a black woman. My fiancée thought it was so stupid and actually pretty rude. His family has never even mentioned my race, and when I told my grandparents that, they said his family is thinking it and just don’t say it out loud. My fiancée was pissed at this point, but he’s patient enough to play nice. Would you all agree my grandparents were out of line? Why do people on the left assume all white people are racist?

For better or for worse he was always there (with half is brain tied behind his back).  As I entered my 30s and had kids myself they also got to hear Rush while riding in the back seat, my wife and I trying to explain some of what he was talking about to them. I'm sure they felt the same way.

MundaneImage13,"Mann, Moran sponsor bills to secure safe harbor for Food for Peace program at USDA • Kansas Reflector","Moran and Mann, along with several Republican colleagues in Congress, introduced bills in the Senate and House to provide a safe harbor for Food for Peace. The program has been relied on to combat hunger for 70 years by feeding 4 billion people in more than 150 countries.

Moran said food aid had proven its value in fostering political stability abroad, bolstering U.S. national security and providing markets for U.S. crops.

“As part of an ongoing effort to save money and increase efficiency, Food for Peace should be moved to the U.S. Department of Agriculture,” Moran said. “By moving this program closer to the producers who grow these crops, we can help reduce waste and make certain our farmers have access to this valuable market.”

\~\~\~  
This Program, Food for Peace, seems like an America First program. Farmers grow crops and sell it to the government which is then used to feed hungry people and generate good will. Seems like a win win situation to me. Am I missing something?",1,0.67,0,1739454076,Conservative

theboss2461,Republicans Are Wrong About Abortion,"We won in 2024 by a small margin. With politicians starting to consider the 2026 midterms, we need to change how we look at abortion in order to convince more moderate and swing voters to pick Republican. We need to ensure a massive victory. **Abortion needs to be illegal** with the only exception being the life of the mother, but we can't win by calling people ""evil murderers"" if they object. They either simply don't care, or are offended by it. We can't compromise our values either, by saying ""allowed until (x) weeks"" or, ""with these exceptions."" The culture around children and parenthood needs to change. Many European and Asian countries are heavily encouraging and promoting motherhood. They have programs and resources to help families start out, yet here in America, we push abortion. So, what do we need to change?

The reason so many people are pro-abortion is because there are many problems in our country that people sympathize with. These people genuinely think death is a better alternative than living in our current society. **They view abortion as the solution.** Republicans, on the other hand, view abortion as a problem that needs to be conquered, but then they don't look at why people actually support it. Instead, we should be looking at solutions that would make people happy to bring new life into this world. 

The two most common excuses given for having an abortion are ""not being ready"" and ""not being able to afford it."" These two reasons make up roughly half of abortions, and are somewhat similar. Women who aren't ready to raise a child don't have the knowledge, confidence, or finances to raise a child. The typical Republican response is ""make it illegal and figure out your own problems.""  This response pushes people towards Democrats who do have a solution. It's a solution we all disagree with, but it's more than nothing. Republicans do have an ability to do something about it. We can influence the education system to incorporate extensive family planning into sex ex in schools, and offer more education resources for adults. Some Republicans are already willing to do this, they just don't incorporate it into the abortion argument. Republicans should be saying ""If you aren't ready to have a child, don't get an abortion, vote Republican to ease your struggles and love your child.""

Parents who can't afford to raise their child are struggling because of our rough economy. The economy that is rough due to Democrat policy. Republicans have already established that we are the ones to make the economy boom. However, when it comes to abortion, women get told to ""figure it out on their own"" or ""pick yourself up by your bootstraps."" Democrats have a solution, ""have an abortion."" This is not the correct answer, but having an answer draws more people to their side than no answer. Republicans should be saying, ""Don't have an abortion, vote Republican to make the economy stronger, and you can afford your child.""

Teen pregnancy is another common excuse given for legalizing abortion. Again, with a Republican led curriculum, schools can offer support and education to teens who get pregnant. Encourage parents to help out, and educate them on proper parenting. These teens are seen as outcasts and villains, which shouldn't be the case. Life should be celebrated even if it's unplanned or too early. 

A woman can always give up her child for adoption, but the left complains that these systems lead to abuse and neglect. Some people doubt whether this claim is even accurate or not, because the adoption system is already heavily regulated and monitored. Either way, we just need Republicans willing to take over the system and solve any potential issues. Republicans could advertise, ""Don't have an abortion, vote Republican to make the adoption system safer.""

There are plenty of other excuses given as well, but my point is the same for all of them. Republicans should look for ways in which they can solve these very real problems with our society, instead of telling people to fend for themselves. If we actually fix these problems, society as a whole would improve. This way, it would be easier to convince people that banning abortion outright is a good idea. We need to praise mothers, make them feel wanted, instead of the outcast. Even outside of the abortion argument, these are all things we should fix and encourage people to vote for. A lot of this is also at the state level, meaning this mid term election is important for more reasons than just the federal house and senate. We need to make the swing states fully red.

According-Activity87,Trump and Elon Musk auditing the government is the greatest thing to happen to America since the Republicans freed the slaves. We can't afford to let this movement die off in 4 years.,"In my wildest dreams, I couldn't imagine that a sincere audit and evaluation of the entire US Federal Government would occur in my lifetime. A businessman becoming president and working to make the government fiscally responsible is the kind of fiction you'd only find in books or films. I really didn't think Trump, in his 2nd term, now approaching 80 years old, was going to hit the ground flat out sprinting like this. It's absolutely miraculous that someone exceptional, like Elon Musk, just happened to exist at the same time and is motivated to help gut the rot from our bloated, corrupt government bureaucracy. 

It's been over 20 years since the government operated without a deficit, and we now have hope we might experience that again before Trump's term ends. I still fear those who have too much to lose from a lean and efficient government will do something radical to stop this great work. Worse, they will likely attempt to field and fund a candidate in 2028 that allows them to refill the swamp.  I know many are overjoyed about our (actual conservatives) recent victory, but let's never forget the price of failure and how truly terrible the last four years have been. This is just the beginning; we have a lot of work to do to ensure America will be a sane, wealthy, and prosperous nation for our children and grandchildren.

TheBearJew963,People on Reddit are nuts.,"I try to avoid using Reddit for political things, but every time I mistakenly go to the popular page every single post is something that is asinine. 

The amount of overreaction to President Trump and Elon Musk is astounding. POTUS is doing exactly what he said he was going to do while running, to the T. He also appointed a guy with a proven record of getting things done to help him slash the budget. Seems smart to me. 

At what point are people going to stop using the word Nazi as a synonym to people they don't like? Mostly asking this question because I'm Jewish and people throwing that word around willy nilly pisses me off. The cognitive dissonance is amazing. People throw words around like Nazi, fascist, and dictator without a clue.

Educational-Pride104,DOGE history,"
Obama created United States Digital Service (USDS) in 2014. It was meant as a bureaucratic patch job to fix the Obamacare website meltdown.  It expanded to other agencies.  He got all the smart and weird tech people from Silicon Valley to come on board. 

Fast forward to 2025. Trump rebrands it DOGE (United States DOGE Service). Keeps the acronym, keeps the funding, but gives it a whole new mission: Find the Receipts. 

Legally untouchable because it was already fully funded and operational. Trump invokes 5 USC 3161, which allows him to create temporary hiring authorities. DOGE teams get embedded inside every single federal agency. Each team consists of a lawyer, HR rep, a zoomer nerd, and an investigator. They report to DOGE, not the agency they're embedded in. 

Trump invokes 44 USC Chapter 35, which governs federal IT and cybersecurity oversight. Since USDS was originally an IT oversight body, DOGE now has full access to all federal data systems.

Congress can't defund it because it's not a new program, just a repurposed one. DOJ can't sue for overreach because Trump used existing laws exactly as written. 
DOGE operates within existing frameworks. 

Obama literally built the perfect Administrative IT backdoor. 

Trump and Musk just took the admin controls. The Administrative State can't stop it without rewriting multiple federal laws. 

Now, for the last 50-100 years, the legislature has been abdicating  more power to the executive branch, rather than doing its job. Dems controlled the House from 1954-1994, and the senate for abt half the time.  They built the current system. ",20,0.77,5,1739404669,Conservative
Smart-Register1460,Where Can I Find Conservative Peers?,"I'm new to Reddit but lurk on this sub. I am a 30 y.o. woman, recently married and expecting a baby. I have voted for both parties and had friends belonging to both parties. I think during Covid, politics ramped up and suddenly everyone was required to have an opinion. I'm a registered dem and always thought that I leaned left. But after 2020, I couldn't ignore the obvious corruption of the democratic party. Covid policies put me over the edge. Then I entered a Masters program and it was literally filled with delusional, sensitive babies who actually stopped us from learning anything substantial because EVERYTHING was about race or gender. Idk. I guess it radicalized me.

 I started watching the other side's point of view and couldn't find much fault in their policies. Getting married and planning for a family also changes A LOT. Perspective has shifted to responsibility fulfillment, open-mindedness, and mostly accepting that I don't know everything. My husband and I find ourselves always siding with conservatives now.

Problem is, my friends are all liberals around my age, and they are MELTING DOWN. I voted for Trump and had to keep it a secret. Every time I hang out with them there is a struggle session. We have to go over all the evils that Trump and Elon are doing. They're cutting off their families, they're in therapy twice a week. Some started taking antidepressants. Idk. I have tried being kind and listening. I'm at the end of my patience. 

How can I find like-minded people that are my own age? They don't even NEED to be conservative. They just need to be respectful and capable of critical thinking. Should I join a local church? What kinds of groups attract these types of folks? ",23,0.79,26,1739403588,Conservative

xQc and Adin Ross weren’t having it, calling her out for virtue signaling and pushing fake outrage. Like, really? Since when is having an opinion on a performance some kind of moral test? 

This whole situation just screams Twitter activism at its finest—shaming people for having personal taste while pretending to be some kind of moral authority. Meanwhile, xQc and Adin Ross are exposing the double standards and hypocrisy behind her take.

  
[Video on the whole subject (Click the text)](https://youtu.be/WXi6cmg3B5g)

What do you guys think? Is this another classic Pokimane virtue signal, or does she actually have a point?



**For the older people in the sub that might not know who these people are a more detailed breakdown of the events and people involved:**                    

**Pokimane** – A popular Twitch streamer and internet personality known for her gaming content and social commentary. She’s been involved in various online controversies, often accused of being performative in her activism.

**xQc** – A former professional Overwatch player turned massive Twitch streamer. He’s known for his loud personality, unfiltered takes, and reaction content.

**Adin Ross** – A streamer who gained popularity through gaming, interviews, and his connection to internet drama. He often gets involved in controversial discussions, especially in the Twitch and YouTube communities.

# What Happened?

During the **Super Bowl Halftime Show**, Kendrick Lamar performed, and while many people enjoyed it, others didn’t. Some criticized the performance for various reasons—maybe they didn’t like the song choices, the stage setup, or just preferred another artist.

Pokimane, however, took issue with those criticisms, claiming that **people who disliked Kendrick’s performance were being racist**. This rubbed a lot of people the wrong way, especially because **disliking a performance doesn’t automatically mean someone is racist**—sometimes, people just don’t like the music.

This led to **xQc and Adin Ross pushing back**, calling her out for **virtue signaling**—which basically means acting like she’s morally superior to gain social approval, even if it’s not genuine. They argued that **not every opinion has to be tied to race**, and shaming people for their personal taste is ridiculous.

# Why It’s a Big Deal

This situation highlights **the ongoing culture war on the internet**—where any opinion can turn into a heated debate about race, morality, and political correctness. Some people feel like **Pokimane was reaching** just to score internet points, while others think she’s calling out real bias.

Juract,So i read the US Constitution,"I don't know how you will take this since the constitution in America is some kind of a political gospel revered for itself.

That's pretty unique. Anywhere else, they revere the nature of the regime (the republic, the crown) or the political principle (democracy and freedom). But not the text of the constitution.

Anyway. So i'm a French Conservative guy. Also happened to have a master degree in law here. I read the US Constitution following the conference by the White House spokeswoman explaining that judges censuring Trump EO were leftist militants weaponizing justice to limit the lawful executive power of the president.

And.. how to say this. It is awfully dated and imprecise

The president really just is a referee of what the congress does. He's also commander in chief for the army and militia (militia ? WTF ?!).

It's never about an executive power the president has or executive orders can give. I guess layers and layers of court decisions had to make up for what's missing.

I also heard about the two supreme court decisions. One that said that persecuting the president for official act was a trespassing from the judiciary branch to the executive. The other that said that regulation by agencies was a denial of the legislative branch.

Everything that's missing and is needed is a legal and political battleground. So good luck with that.

If it wasn't such a gospel, you could just write it all down again with precised provisions of what the president and anyone can do, with the ways and forms technical regulations can be made.",61,0.71,55,1739396825,Conservative

They are not going to jump on the grenade that is these decisions. There might someday be a fight with a president about something where he is legally in the wrong, but this is not that time. This is not the hill the Supreme Court will die on. Wisely, Trump’s not adding fuel to the fire by threatening to do what it’s very clear he can do, which is disobey. This provides SCOTUS the cover it needs to deal with these upstart district courts without looking like Trump strong-armed it.

I remember spending an hours with my politics professor talking about the web of Russia collusion accusations. I was so fascinated that treason was unfolding in real time. The inter-web of this billionaire businessman colluding with foreign enemy. When the information came out, I was so confused about how my perception of reality was wrong.

In regards to DNC, I will never be a socialist, I disagree with it fully. However, Sanders was telling a message that things were rigged against the commoner. I respected him for standing up to traditional way of thinking. I remember seeing a picture of him when he was younger at a protest (i think Kent state but no it 100% sure) and respected that he stayed true to himself. Then the DNC colluded against him and instead of fighting for what he believed in he just rolled over. Now at the DNC he goes up after one billionaire complains about billionaires then another billionaire comes out to speak. He doesnt respect himself so i can longer respect him.

Junior-Mess-898,Cheers to the competency crisis,"Just want to issue a perspective I have.

I grew up poor as hell in New Jersey. Father died when I was 10, and my ma was an alcoholic who still managed to keep me and my sister fed. 

I’ve worked in the trades since I was 14, and I am now 37. I graduated high in my class in high school but chose to continue in my feild instead. 

I moved to nyc in 2009, making something like 18/hr in infrastructure repair. I was told repeatedly by my friends/family/colleagues that I should’ve gone to college to get a better job that would pay better. 

Now I’m a foreman and make around 150k-175k. Zero debts my whole life. Hardwork does in fact lead to success. You just need to have a half decent brain and a willingness to actually work hard to profit a company. Never on unemployment , never stopped working during Covid. 

Politicians and the government as an entirety have never represented me and those around me. They have abandoned the thought of who keeps this country running. 

Gov. Jobs definitely don’t mean a damn to the general public, so why do dems give so much care to it? I get 3x pay to work in Canada and South America during crisis. America isn’t paying my wages during this period.

My take is that we have an exorbitant amount of useless labor. They’ve got nothing to offer but a bleeding heart and a desperate need to feel useful. 

Don’t stop at DOGE, please also remove the DOB legislators, the failed architect turned project managers, and the state union contracts. All for unions as an entity but I’ve run 60 man crews and have seen tax dollars be burned before my eyes. Literal nepotism families who can hang a single z-clip in 10 hours because the foreman isn’t there to do layout. 

They are all losing it, and I’ve never felt better. Things are starting to make perfect sense.

What do you guys think? Should society be forced to accommodate people’s lifestyle choices, or is this just another case of extreme entitlement? Let’s discuss.",11,0.88,3,1739303687,Conservative

Great analysis by Albert Mohler this morning about how and why Trump is doing certain things. They may seem unrelated, but Mohler sees a supreme Court showdown to reinforce the Article 2 Vesting Clause for the presidential powers. He sees the issue of three branches of government, with the president controlling the Executive branch. However, the EB has grown into the Administrative State, controlled by Congress, and fostering a ""deep state"" beyond executive or even congressional control. How Trump's actions are forcing the issue and have a better than good chance based on the text of the constitution. ",6,0.88,0,1739302170,Conservative

Maybe it reminds them of the glory days of shoving flowers into gun barrels yet they’ve turned into war-hawks when it comes to Ukraine…hmmm…vaccines? Anyway, they are more concerned with bumper stickers and vandalizing Tesla vehicles than rooting out fraud, waste, and abuse concerning their tax dollars.

RecentMonk1082,why do conservatives care about peoples business do more then liberals do?,I just want to say I was born into a liberal family. And my family are always democratic voters and even then I think I will always be liberal I don't see myself ever voting for a republican or conservative because I see no need to. I took a recently political test and found out I am more of a socialist democrat on the fact I care more about peoples rights then I do for anything else. Such as woman's rights to abortions etc. Yet I can never understand why conservatives feel the need to get into peoples business. When Biden  was president he passed the marriage equality act which the republicans barley agreed to which allowed same sex couples to marry. And yet somehow conservatives thought by passing this it was going to affect their right to marry when all it did was make it to where same sex couples could marry like straight ones. And then here I am thinking as a pan-sexual trans woman why do they care so much about who marries who I don't care who someone else's marries because I think its none of my business to care. I notice liberals work more with conservatives then conservatives work with liberals when conservatives introduce something they typically try to negation with them and or find a better replacement conservatives just want to stall and not offer any replacement whatsoever. As far as same sex couples go as well they always say marriage is meant to be by god or for some religious reason when legal marriage is just the state and county singing a piece of paper it has nothing to do with religion.

Dems in congress are paralyzed and powerless. AGs are suing, but the courts are too slow. Protests are happening, but the energy isn’t there. 

Meanwhile, conservatives are brainwashing millions online, while we’re still stuck walking door to door like it’s 2008. Protesting is important, I’ll try to go tomorrow, but we need a complimentary online blitz.

**How can we flip the switch?**

Where is the energy of the tiktokers who trolled Trump by buying out his rally tickets? 

What if we formed our own version of a bot farm, except with real humans, us, where we target specific posts or upvote certain comments. I’m dead serious. Is it right, is it ethical, who cares anymore? We could start a signal chat. Call ourselves DOGE - Disbanding Oligarchy Gaining Equality.

Billboards. Trolling Elon and Trump. 

-A billboard of that picture Elon hates where he’s balding, and the line “this guy has access to your data.” I think Trump getting in bed with the other billionaire bros is a huge weak spot for maga and the weak link we need to exploit. 

-A billboard of Bezos, Zuck, Musk and Trump that says “they get rich, you get screwed.”

I have the time. I have money to spend, but I can’t sponsor billboards on my own. I also don’t feel tech savvy enough to really tackle any of this without help.

Side note-

Democrat is becoming a dirty word. I have seen this on TikTok with many of our young adults not wanting to identify as democrat, even if they are left. They prefer leftist, which leads them to follow creators who spend more time attacking democrats than republicans. 

I understand and share your critiques of the party, but every time you comment something like “the democrats have no balls” or “feels like we have no opposition party” it enforces apathy and suppresses turnout. YOU might still vote despite your frustration, but 50 people who read your comment may not. Plus it’s not exactly true. There are democrats everywhere fighting, I am proud of my senators in Oregon who fight daily. They don’t have TikTok, so are not seen like AOC. 

Okay final thoughts.

Throughout history, small organized groups have changed the course of history, against overwhelming odds. Feels like people long to be part of something, a purpose, a resistance. Well the time is now. Let’s fight dirty, how can we take back our online spaces?

mistymiso,Something feels different about Trump…,"Is Trump even in charge anymore? Or is he just the mascot while the real operators push their most extreme agenda?

Look at 2025—Trump barely shows up. When he does, he stumbles through speeches, loses his train of thought, and rambles incoherently. And sure, he’s always rambled, but this is different. Before, even when he was spewing nonsense, he had energy—this weird, chaotic showmanship that kept people engaged. Now, he just looks lost, like he’s struggling to keep up.

The people running the show— Elon Musk, JD Vance, Stephen Miller, the Heritage Foundation—are doing their most extreme, dystopian work because they know Trump’s base will go along with it. Trump isn’t thinking through policies or making decisions. He just signs whatever they put in front of him. The new MAGA leaders aren’t following him—they’re using him, waiting for him to fade so they can take over completely.

And something feels off about all of it. His rambling used to feel intentional, like he was riffing and playing to the crowd. Now, it just feels like he’s confused, meandering, and barely aware of what he’s saying. His movement is moving on without him, and he’s just along for the ride.

But it’s not just that he’s weaker—there’s a different vibe now. It feels more sinister. Yeah, he’s been through a lot with the courts and everything, but it also feels like he’s put people in charge who are really going to push that agenda, harder than he ever could.

It is so crazy to just watch Musk do this in front of everyone, and no one has a way to stop it at all.

tinfoiltatty,How to Stop a Self-Coup,"The U.S. executive branch is knowingly breaking numerous laws. (Illegally cutting off federal funding, illegally shutting down federal agencies, illegally firing various federal employees, illegally granting access to sensitive government data and software, illegally offering resignation buyouts to federal employees, etc.)

Who can stop the coup and how? A brief guide\*:

**Step 1: Courts**

Many lawsuits have been filed and continue to be filed against the executive branch. Judges have already begun issuing injunctions and rulings against the executive branch. If the executive branch abides by the injunctions and rulings (or abides while appealing the cases and ultimately abides by the final ruling) the coup stops here. 🛑 If not, proceed to step 2. ➡️

**Note:** If a case reaches the Supreme Court and the partisan justices issue a blatantly unconstitutional ruling, skip ahead to step 3. ➡️

**Step 2: DOJ**

A judge can rule that the defendant is in contempt of court. Then the Department of Justice, which is part of the executive branch, orders the U.S. Marshals to arrest them and bring them to court. If the DOJ does its job, the coup stops here. 🛑 If not, proceed to step 3. ➡️

**Step 3: Congress**

Congress has the power to impeach and convict the President, Vice President, Supreme Court justices, and any civil officers of the United States. Upon conviction, the person found guilty is removed from office. If Congress does its job, the coup stops here. 🛑 If not, proceed to step 4. ➡️

**Step 4: The People**

Nonviolent protests that engage at least 3.5% of the population have [historically never failed](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190513-it-only-takes-35-of-people-to-change-the-world). In the U.S. this threshold is around 12 million people. (75 million people voted for Kamala Harris, so this threshold amounts to 16% of Harris voters.) The coup stops here. 🛑

**Actions you can take during the steps above:**

* Call your U.S. Senators and Congress Rep every day. ([5 Calls app ](https://5calls.org/)makes this easy.) Put pressure on them to stop the coup. Tell them to use their media influence to inform the public about the coup.
* Spread the word. Make sure your friends and family know about the coup.
* If you’re a journalist: Remind your editors that we’re in the middle of a coup. It deserves as much (if not more) coverage than a plane crash.
* If you’re a federal employee: Hold the line, don’t resign.
* If you’re active military: Remember that you’re legally required to disobey unlawful orders.

**Additional recommendations:**

* Join the [Indivisible](https://indivisible.org/) email list for updates and coordinated action plans.
* There are 2 House seats up for grabs in a special election in Florida on April 1. Consider volunteering or donating to Democratic candidates [Josh Weil](https://www.joshweil.us/) and [Gay Valimont](https://gayforcongress.com/).

*****
""I'm a liberal, but that doesn't mean what a lot of you apparently think it does. Let's break it down, shall we? Because quite frankly, I'm getting a little tired of being told what I believe and what I stand for. Spoiler alert: not every liberal is the same, though the majority of liberals I know think along roughly these same lines:

1. I believe a country should take care of its weakest members. A country cannot call itself civilized when its children, disabled, sick, and elderly are neglected. PERIOD.

2. I believe healthcare is a right, not a privilege. Somehow that's interpreted as ""I believe Obamacare is the end-all, be-all."" This is not the case. I'm fully aware that the ACA has problems, that a national healthcare system would require everyone to chip in, and that it's impossible to create one that is devoid of flaws, but I have yet to hear an argument against it that makes ""let people die because they can't afford healthcare"" a better alternative. I believe healthcare should be far cheaper than it is, and that everyone should have access to it. And no, I'm not opposed to paying higher taxes in the name of making that happen.

3. I believe education should be affordable. It doesn't necessarily have to be free (though it works in other countries so I'm mystified as to why it can't work in the US), but at the end of the day, there is no excuse for students graduating college saddled with five- or six-figure debt.

4. I don't believe your money should be taken from you and given to people who don't want to work. I have literally never encountered anyone who believes this. Ever. I just have a massive moral problem with a society where a handful of people can possess the majority of the wealth while there are people literally starving to death, freezing to death, or dying because they can't afford to go to the doctor. Fair wages, lower housing costs, universal healthcare, affordable education, and the wealthy actually paying their share would go a long way toward alleviating this. Somehow believing that makes me a communist.

5. I don't throw around ""I'm willing to pay higher taxes"" lightly. If I'm suggesting something that involves paying more, well, it's because I'm fine with paying my share as long as it's actually going to something besides lining corporate pockets or bombing other countries while Americans die without healthcare.

6. I believe companies should be required to pay their employees a decent, livable wage. Somehow this is always interpreted as me wanting burger flippers to be able to afford a penthouse apartment and a Mercedes. What it actually means is that no one should have to work three full-time jobs just to keep their head above water. Restaurant servers should not have to rely on tips, multibillion-dollar companies should not have employees on food stamps, workers shouldn't have to work themselves into the ground just to barely make ends meet, and minimum wage should be enough for someone to work 40 hours and live.

7. I am not anti-Christian. I have no desire to stop Christians from being Christians, to close churches, to ban the Bible, to forbid prayer in school, etc. (BTW, prayer in school is NOT illegal; *compulsory* prayer in school is - and should be - illegal). All I ask is that Christians recognize *my* right to live according to *my* beliefs. When I get pissed off that a politician is trying to legislate Scripture into law, I'm not ""offended by Christianity"" -- I'm offended that you're trying to force me to live by your religion's rules. You know how you get really upset at the thought of Muslims imposing Sharia law on you? That's how I feel about Christians trying to impose biblical law on me. Be a Christian. Do your thing. Just don't force it on me or mine.

8. I don't believe LGBT people should have more rights than you. I just believe they should have the *same* rights as you.

9. I don't believe illegal immigrants should come to America and have the world at their feet, especially since THIS ISN'T WHAT THEY DO (spoiler: undocumented immigrants are ineligible for all those programs they're supposed to be abusing, and if they're ""stealing"" your job it's because your employer is hiring illegally). I believe there are far more humane ways to handle undocumented immigration than our current practices (i.e., detaining children, splitting up families, ending DACA, etc).

10. I don't believe the government should regulate everything, but since greed is such a driving force in our country, we NEED regulations to prevent cut corners, environmental destruction, tainted food/water, unsafe materials in consumable goods or medical equipment, etc. It's not that I want the government's hands in everything -- I just don't trust people trying to make money to ensure that their products/practices/etc. are actually SAFE. Is the government devoid of shadiness? Of course not. But with those regulations in place, consumers have recourse if they're harmed and companies are liable for medical bills, environmental cleanup, etc. Just kind of seems like common sense when the alternative to government regulation is letting companies bring their bottom line into the equation.

11. I believe our current administration is fascist. Not because I dislike them or because I can’t get over an election, but because I've spent too many years reading and learning about the Third Reich to miss the similarities. Not because any administration I dislike must be Nazis, but because things are actually mirroring authoritarian and fascist regimes of the past.

12. I believe the systemic racism and misogyny in our society is much worse than many people think, and desperately needs to be addressed. Which means those with privilege -- white, straight, male, economic, etc. -- need to start listening, even if you don't like what you're hearing, so we can start dismantling everything that's causing people to be marginalized.

13. I am not interested in coming after your blessed guns, nor is anyone serving in government. What I am interested in is the enforcement of present laws and enacting new, common sense gun regulations. Got another opinion? Put it on your page, not mine.

14. I believe in so-called political correctness. I prefer to think it’s social politeness. If I call you Chuck and you say you prefer to be called Charles I’ll call you Charles. It’s the polite thing to do. Not because everyone is a delicate snowflake, but because as Maya Angelou put it, when we know better, we do better. When someone tells you that a term or phrase is more accurate/less hurtful than the one you're using, you now know better. So why not do better? How does it hurt you to NOT hurt another person?

15. I believe in funding sustainable energy, including offering education to people currently working in coal or oil so they can change jobs. There are too many sustainable options available for us to continue with coal and oil. Sorry, billionaires. Maybe try investing in something else.

16. I believe that women should not be treated as a separate class of human. They should be paid the same as men who do the same work, should have the same rights as men and should be free from abuse. Why on earth shouldn’t they be?

I think that about covers it. Bottom line is that I'm a liberal because I think we should take care of each other. That doesn't mean you should work 80 hours a week so your lazy neighbor can get all your money. It just means I don't believe there is any scenario in which preventable suffering is an acceptable outcome as long as money is saved.""

Whimsywynn3,Worry about schools using right wing curriculum,"I recently wrote a strongly worded email to my child’s principal and district superintendent, and honestly anyone else that looked mildly important on the district website, about the “Indoctrination of K-12 schools” executive order and how worried I was for the changes in curriculum that it implies. 

I got an accidental reply, someone in the district forwarded it to someone else and said it was a “form letter” but they should reply to me anyways. It actually isn’t a form letter but it got me thinking…maybe it could be! So here it is in case anyone else wants to edit it, send it to whoever will be most bothered. 


To whom it may concern,

My name is ______ and I am a concerned parent within the _______ School District. I am deeply disturbed over the current president’s executive order for “Ending Radical Indoctrination in K-12 Schooling”.

This executive order is in itself an appalling and overzealous attempt to indoctrinate my child and the children of our community into believing a singular and all together false account of our national history.

I am writing to you today to specifically talk about Section 3 B. 

“(viii)  “the United States is fundamentally racist, sexist, or otherwise discriminatory.

And the following Section D:
“Patriotic education” means a presentation of the history of America grounded in: 
(i)    an accurate, honest, unifying, inspiring, and ennobling characterization of America’s founding and foundational principles; 
(ii)   a clear examination of how the United States has admirably grown closer to its noble principles throughout its history; 
(iii)  the concept that commitment to America’s aspirations is beneficial and justified; and
(iv)   the concept that celebration of America’s greatness and history is proper.”

I have the utmost trust in our college-educated, professionally trained and licensed teachers to display a developmentally appropriate yet accurate reflection of history throughout all grade levels. However, I am concerned for the ways that our school’s curriculum may be forced to change, either within this school year or the years following, to accommodate the aforementioned demands.

The federal government is trying to enforce by a law a subjective manner of tone. What exactly constitutes “accurate and ennobling” when considering the ways various marginalized citizens have fought to earn human rights in America?

Subverting the racial and sexist reality of our nation’s history erases our community members’ struggles, laying the groundwork for future discrimination, and creating an environment where the subjective tone of factual events can be punishable by law and funding. 

I ask that you are transparent if and when ______ School and all schools within __________ School District are altering any policies or curriculum to accommodate the aforementioned and all additional sections of this executive order.

And I demand, as a community member and parent, that you DON’T allow the extreme overreach of federal government into our children’s education and livelihood.

WeenFan4Life,What do you think? Afghanistan in 70s vs US today?,"The transformation of Afghanistan in the 1970s into a conservative religious state and recent cultural shifts in the United States share some parallels in terms of societal responses to modernization, polarization, and the role of religion.

Similarities:

1. Backlash Against Modernization:

   - In Afghanistan, rapid modernization efforts in the 20th century—such as women's education and secular reforms—provoked strong resistance from conservative rural populations, leading to a reversal toward religious conservatism.

   - In the U.S., cultural debates over progressive policies (e.g., gender rights, education reforms) have fueled polarization, with some groups advocating for a return to traditional or religious values.


2. Urban-Rural Divide:

   - Afghanistan experienced a widening gap between urban elites embracing modernization and rural communities adhering to traditional Islamic norms[2].

   - Similarly, the U.S. has seen divisions between urban areas leaning progressive and rural regions favoring conservative ideologies.


3. Rise of Religious Conservatism:

   - In Afghanistan, political instability and external interventions enabled the rise of Islamist movements like the Taliban, which imposed strict religious laws.

   - In the U.S., there has been a resurgence of Christian nationalist rhetoric among certain political factions, emphasizing religion's role in governance.


4. Polarization and Reactionary Movements:

   - In both contexts, societal polarization has led to reactionary movements opposing perceived threats to cultural or religious identity, whether through Islamization in Afghanistan or conservative pushes in the U.S.


While the specifics differ—Afghanistan's changes were shaped by war and foreign intervention—the underlying dynamics of resistance to rapid change and cultural divides are comparable.",23,0.78,21,1738946754,Liberal

One of the most important statements from the Summary.

&gt;**Several members expressed concern about the Administration's budget requests** to reduce or eliminate funding for programs that utilize U.S. agricultural commodities, ***fearing it would negatively impact American farmers***.

[https://www.congress.gov/event/116th-congress/house-event/110307/text](https://www.congress.gov/event/116th-congress/house-event/110307/text)

This document is a transcript of a House Committee Hearing titled **""The Implementation of Farm Bill International Food Assistance and Development Programs""**. The hearing took place on December 10, 2019, before the Subcommittee on Livestock and Foreign Agriculture of the House Committee on Agriculture.

The hearing focused on the implementation of the international food assistance and development programs authorized by the 2018 Farm Bill. Key topics and themes discussed during the hearing include:

* **The importance of international food assistance programs** in addressing humanitarian needs, enhancing national security, and promoting global stability and cooperation.
* **The role of various programs** such as McGovern-Dole Food for Education, Food for Progress, and Food for Peace. These programs aim to provide food assistance, improve agricultural practices, and build capacity in developing countries.
* **The collaboration between the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)** in implementing these programs. Both agencies work with various partners, including non-governmental organizations and international organizations.
* ***The emphasis on using U.S. agricultural commodities*** in food aid programs. Members of the subcommittee expressed concern that there may be a bias towards cash and vouchers, and wanted to ensure American farmers and their products are a key part of the programs.
* **The importance of program oversight and accountability** to ensure that aid reaches the intended beneficiaries and is not misused. Monitoring methods include third-party monitoring, biometric registration, and feedback hotlines.
* **The budget requests from the Administration** to consolidate international food assistance programs into a single account which would reduce funding for some programs. This proposed consolidation raised concerns among committee members who believe it would diminish the role of the USDA and potentially reduce the amount of U.S. commodities used in the food programs.
* **The role of these programs in national security**, by increasing global stability, and cooperation. The programs also aim to promote international partnerships and mutually beneficial trading relationships.

The hearing included testimonies from Ken Isley, Administrator of the Foreign Agricultural Service at USDA, and Trey Hicks, Director of the Office of Food for Peace at USAID. Members of the Subcommittee asked questions and expressed their views on the implementation of these programs.

Several representatives expressed comments and concerns regarding farmers, American farmers, and farm families during the House Committee Hearing on ""The Implementation of Farm Bill International Food Assistance and Development Programs."" These comments emphasize the importance of supporting American agriculture through international food assistance programs.

Here are some of the key points made by the representatives:

* **Jim Costa (Democrat), Chairman of the Subcommittee,** stated that American farmers, ranchers, dairymen, and women are the ones who produce the food for these programs and ""nobody does it better than the American farmer"". He emphasized that providing support improves livelihoods and builds partnerships throughout the breadbasket of America.
* ***David Rouzer (Republican)*****, Ranking Member of the Subcommittee,** highlighted the role of American farmers in producing the crops delivered through in-kind food aid. He stated that ""a bag of rice, wheat, flour, or any one of dozens of other products grown by U.S. farmers are powerful symbols of the productivity and generosity of America"". He also noted that food assistance and international agriculture development rely on partnerships with ""fine farm families"" and food processors in the United States. He stressed that U.S. farm products are ""the true backbone of the assistance the United States provides"" and that ""American agriculture in-kind assistance remains as the backbone for years to come"".
* ***K. Michael Conaway (Republican)*****, a Representative in Congress from Texas,** stated that there is a ""strong partnership between USDA and USAID"" and a ""broad coalition of stakeholders both in the United States and internationally"". He expressed concern that there may be a bias in favor of cash and vouchers over in-kind food purchases and wanted to ensure that American farmers participate in these programs. He also noted that the American people support these programs in large part because they believe it is American-grown products that are being used.
* **Collin C. Peterson (Democrat), a Representative in Congress from Minnesota,** noted that dry peas and lentils, which are a staple in international food assistance programs, had dropped significantly in price. He pointed out that this drop in price should have resulted in more purchases of these commodities, benefiting American farmers who produce them.
* ***Roger W. Marshall (Republican)*****, a Representative in Congress from Kansas**, mentioned the history of the Food for Peace program, which was started by a Kansas farmer and later signed into legislation by President Eisenhower, also from Kansas. He also emphasized that it is important to him that the programs use agriculture products made in the U.S.
* **Jim Hagedorn (passed away, but his words are important), a Representative in Congress from Minnesota,** stated that these programs ""demonstrate the wonderful system of agriculture that we have, the expertise and the technology and in ag land with our farmers' hard work and the work that is done by our agribusinesses puts us in a position not just to trade with other countries and help provide food, but to literally give it away in many instances here to help people all around the world."" He added, ""We are very much interested in you taking products from our farmers and sending them to other countries, and not necessarily distribute cash payments. We think that that is very important"".
* **Don Bacon (Republican), a Representative in Congress from Nebraska,** stated that ""Nebraska is proud of being like the lead exporter for beef, and go up and down the line and agriculture is one of our nation's strengths and it is a source of our nation's power and prosperity. And I just tell you, our farmers and our agriculture sector in Nebraska are proud to help feed the world, and we prefer not handing a check. We like providing our surplus, which we have"". He also noted that American farmers are a ""force for good"".

In summary, the ***representatives from both sides of the aisle showed a strong interest in ensuring that American farmers and farm families benefit*** from international food assistance programs by selling their products and also through having the programs enhance the image of American agriculture globally. They expressed concerns about potential shifts away from in-kind aid and towards cash assistance, which they see as a threat to American agricultural producers.

plasticpixels,FOR THOSE OF YOU LOOKING TO TURN YOUR ANGER INTO ACTION…,"Here’s some advice from a high-level staffer for a Senator. Re-posting from a friend of mine:  
There are two things that we should be doing all the time right now, and they’re by far the most important things.  
You should NOT be bothering with online petitions or emailing.  
  
1) The best thing you can do to be heard and get your congressperson to pay attention is to have face-to-face time — if they have town halls, go to them. Go to their local offices. If you’re in DC, try to find a way to go to an event of theirs. Go to the “mobile offices” that their staff hold periodically (all these times are located on each congressperson’s website). When you go, ask questions. A lot of them. And push for answers. The louder and more vocal and present you can be at those the better.  
  
2) But those in-person events don’t happen every day. So, the absolute most important thing that people should be doing every day is calling.  
  
YOU SHOULD MAKE 6 CALLS A DAY:  
2 each (DC office and your local office) to your 2 Senators &amp; your 1 Representative.  
  
The staffer was very clear that any sort of online contact basically gets immediately ignored, and letters pretty much get thrown in the trash (unless you have a particularly strong emotional story — but even then it’s not worth the time it took you to craft that letter).  
  
Calls are what all the congresspeople pay attention to. Every single day, the Senior Staff and the Senator get a report of the 3 most-called-about topics for that day at each of their offices (in DC and local offices), and exactly how many people said what about each of those topics. They’re also sorted by zip code and area code. She said that Republican callers generally outnumber Democrat callers 4-1, and when it’s a particular issue that single-issue-voters pay attention to (like gun control, or planned parenthood funding, etc...), it’s often closer to 11-1, and that’s recently pushed Republican congressmen on the fence to vote with the Republicans. In the last 8 years, Republicans have called, and Democrats haven’t.  
  
So, when you call:  
     A) When calling the DC office, ask for the Staff member in charge of whatever you’re calling about (“Hi, I’d like to speak with the staffer in charge of Healthcare, please”) — local offices won’t always have specific ones, but they might. If you get transferred to that person, awesome. If you don’t, that’s ok — ask for that person’s name, and then just keep talking to whoever answered the phone. Don’t leave a message (unless the office doesn’t pick up at all — then you can — but it’s better to talk to the staffer who first answered than leave a message for the specific staffer in charge of your topic).  
   
Give them your zip code. They won’t always ask for it, but make sure you give it to them, so they can mark it down. Extra points if you live in a zip code that traditionally votes for them, since they’ll want to make sure they get/keep your vote.  
  
     C) If you can make it personal, make it personal. “I voted for you in the last election and I’m worried/happy/whatever” or “I’m a teacher, and I am appalled by Betsy DeVos,” or “as a single mother” or “as a white, middle class woman,” or whatever.  
  
     D) Pick 1-2 specific things per day to focus on. Don’t rattle off everything you’re concerned about — they’re figuring out what 1-2 topics to mark you down for on their lists. So, focus on 1-2 per day. Ideally something that will be voted on/taken up in the next few days, but it doesn’t really matter — even if there’s not a vote coming up in the next week, call anyway. It’s important that they just keep getting calls.  
  
     E) Be clear on what you want — “I’m disappointed that the Senator...” or “I want to thank the Senator for their vote on... “ or “I want the Senator to know that voting in _____ way is the wrong decision for our state because... “ Don’t leave any ambiguity.  
  
     F) They may get to know your voice/get sick of you — it doesn’t matter. The people answering the phones generally turn over every 6 weeks anyway, so even if they’re really sick of you, they’ll be gone in 6 weeks.  
  
From experience since the election: If you hate being on the phone &amp; feel awkward (which is a lot of people) don’t worry about it — there are a bunch of scripts (Indivisible has some, there are lots of others floating around these day). After a few days of calling, it starts to feel a lot more natural.  
  
Put the 6 numbers in your phone (all under P – Politician.) An example is McCaskill MO, Politician McCaskill DC, Politician Blunt MO, etc., which makes it really easy to click down the list each day.",89,0.89,34,1738771434,Liberal

**Subject:** Urgent Action Needed to Prevent the Exploitation of Incarcerated Individuals in Medical Research &amp; Protect Human Rights

Dear \[Senators Name\],

I am writing to express my deep concern regarding the potential exploitation of incarcerated individuals in experimental medical research, particularly as Neuralink, a company owned by Elon Musk, begins human trials for its controversial brain-computer interface (BCI) technology. Given Musk’s erratic behavior and Neuralink’s history of unethical animal testing, there is a real and urgent risk that prisoners—who are among the most vulnerable populations in the U.S.—could be coerced or incentivized into dangerous experiments with inadequate oversight and informed consent.

While existing regulations under the Common Rule (45 CFR 46 Subpart C) provide some restrictions on medical research involving prisoners, loopholes remain that allow private companies to:

* **Target incarcerated individuals** as test subjects, leveraging their lack of autonomy and limited access to legal representation.
* **Use financial incentives or promises of better treatment** to pressure participation, making true informed consent questionable.
* **Claim that participation is ""voluntary""** when, in reality, the prison environment inherently creates coercive conditions.

Given Neuralink’s troubling track record—including reports of animal suffering, rushed testing procedures, and serious safety concerns raised by the FDA—it is imperative that Congress acts now to prevent the exploitation of prisoners in experimental research that does not serve their direct medical interests.

# Additional Concern: Expansion of Guantánamo Bay Detention Facility

Furthermore, I am alarmed by recent reports that the administration plans to expand the detention facilities at Guantánamo Bay to house up to 30,000 deported migrants as part of the Laken Riley Act and accompanying executive actions. This expansion raises significant human rights concerns, particularly regarding the potential for detainees to be subjected to experimental medical procedures without proper consent. The combination of an increased detained population and the initiation of human trials by companies like Neuralink heightens the risk of unethical practices.

# Escalating Threat: U.S. Withdrawal from the UN Human Rights Council

In addition to these alarming developments, President Trump has announced the withdrawal of the United States from the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) and the cessation of funding for the UN agency aiding Palestinian refugees, UNRWA. [apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/05e1d57bbb41df38771d1ab69adb21a3?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

The UNHRC serves as a critical global watchdog against human rights violations, including unethical medical experimentation, coercion, and abuse of vulnerable populations. This withdrawal diminishes international oversight and increases the risk of human rights abuses going unchecked.

The U.S. has a documented history of medical experimentation on prisoners—from the Tuskegee syphilis experiments to radiation testing on inmates. We must not allow billionaires and private corporations to revive these unethical practices under the guise of “innovation,” especially at a time when the U.S. is distancing itself from international human rights protections.

# Proposed Legislative Protections

I urge you to introduce or support new legislation that would:

* **Explicitly prohibit high-risk medical experiments on incarcerated individuals**, unless the research directly benefits their own health and well-being.
* **Close loopholes** that allow private corporations to conduct research on prisoners under the guise of “voluntary” participation.
* **Mandate strict third-party oversight and legal representation** for any study involving incarcerated individuals.
* **Implement severe penalties** for companies found to be coercing or targeting prisoners for experimental trials.
* **Ban private companies from lobbying** to weaken prisoner protections in medical research.
* **Ensure the U.S. remains accountable to international human rights standards**, despite its withdrawal from the UNHRC.

This is not just a medical ethics issue—it is a human rights issue. I urge you to take immediate action to protect vulnerable individuals from corporate exploitation and prevent Neuralink—or any other private entity—from using prisoners as test subjects for unproven, high-risk medical procedures.

Thank you for your time, leadership, and commitment to justice. I look forward to your response.

Sincerely,

\[Your Name\]

bigelow6698,Pro-choice people clearly care more about the issue and are more passionate/enthusiastic about the issue.,"Therefore, single issue voting on abortion benefits pro-choice people more than it benefits pro-life people. 

A report by Gallup published in June of 2024 cited the following statistics. 

- 54% of Americans are pro-choice. 

This does not mean that 46% of Americans are pro-life, some people are not sure what they think or simply do not care much about the issue. 

- 41% of Americans identify as pro-life. 

That is a decrease from a decade prior. 

- 40% of pro-choice voters say that they would not vote for a candidate who disagrees with them on abortion, compared to only 22% of pro-life voters. 

Think about that, even if someone is pro-life, they might be willing to vote for a pro-choice candidate if the pro-choice candidate agrees with them (them being the pro-life voters) on a different issue. An opposite scenario (a pro-choice voter supporting a pro-life candidate due to agreement regarding a different issue) is statistically far less likely to happen. 

https://news.gallup.com/poll/645836/record-share-electorate-pro-choice-voting.aspx 

According to USA Today, a lot of Republicans are dropping their anti-abortion values (either turning pro-choice or just becoming more willing to compromise on it) and that is how Trump was able to win and how the Republicans were able to take control of both the Senate and the House. Donald Trump actually said that, if Congress tried to pass a nationwide abortion ban, he would veto it. 

https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2024/11/18/trump-abortion-stance-republicans-pro-life/76208481007/ 

The above article by USA Today was written by an anti-abortion advocate, explaining why Trump’s reelection probably will not signify that the pro-life crowd is anywhere near ending abortion once and for all. 

Opinion based assessments of current events should usually be taken with a grain of salt, because they can be tinted by wishful thinking. However, the aforementioned article by USA today was written by Dace Potas, an actual anti-abortion advocate. If Potas is going to skew the data because of wishful thinking, Potas would probably do so in such a way as to make the situation seem much better for the anti-abortion people or much worse for pro-choice people than is the case here in reality. It seems pretty unlikely that someone, who wants to end abortion, would skew the data to make it seem better for supporters of abortion rights or worse for opponents of abortion rights than is the case here in reality.  

As a pro-choice person, I feel that this is good news. However, it makes me wonder what percent of the people in the anti-abortion crowd have really thought through the issue. 

The pro-life position literally says; A fetus is a person, the fetus’ right to live takes precedent over a woman’s right to control what happens to her body and this issue is so important that the government has a duty to intervene and force a woman to remain pregnant. 

If I believed that, I would not be willing to compromise on the issue.

bellboy905,Trump is purging federal law enforcement so he can pull off his Reichstag fire.,"Thanks to their private texts and public pronouncements, we know that Trump and his lackeys have salivated for years over the prospect of ""Marshall Law."" We also know from Trump's inaction on J6, his ritual celebration of that day's violence, his vilification of the cops who defended the Capitol, and his pardons of cop-bludgeoning brownshirts that he is pro-coup. And we know from his campaign promises that he's chomping at the bit to sic the U.S. military on U.S. citizens. He just needs a pretext, and once again, his Proud Boys are ""standing by"" to provide it. The only thing stopping them is federal law enforcement, and Trump can remove this obstacle by purging agents with integrity who do their jobs. 

""The day after the fire, at Hitler's request, President Hindenburg signed the Reichstag Fire Decree into law,"" according to Wikipedia. The decree ""suspended most civil liberties in Germany, including habeas corpus, freedom of expression, freedom of the press, the right of free association and public assembly, and the secrecy of the post and telephone."" Which squares pretty well with Trump's wish list for America. 

The Reichstag Fire Decree, Wikipedia continues, ""was used by the Nazis to ban publications not considered friendly."" Trump has, of course, proposed doing just that to unfriendly ""fake news"" outlets. 

""Hitler, after having obtained his emergency powers, announced that it was the start of a wider communist effort to take over Germany,"" per Wikipedia. Sounds like the Deep State™ conspiracies of Trump's paranoid fantasies.

bigelow6698,Will Trump really end democracy?,"There seem to be quite a few people who believe that Trump will literally end democracy and that there will not be an election in 2028, because Trump will become dictator as Hitler did. 

Here are my thoughts. 

Even if Trump wants to become dictator (and if anyone would derive a sadistic joy from that it would be him) I still do not think that his attempt to become dictator would be successful. 

A report by The Guardian explained why the Trump administration is pretty unlikely to end democracy ( https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/06/will-trump-destroy-us-democracy ). Victor Orban destroyed democracy in Hungary. That might make you think that Trump will do the same to America. However, the system is much more complex and rigid in The US. It is unbelievably difficult to amend the constitution, I doubt that such a process would happen in the course of the next four years. To see why and how I can be so sure of that, research how an amendment can be added to the US constitution. While Trump can, and will, attempt to weaken democracy, it is hard to say how successful such an attempt will be. Furthermore, He cannot cancel the 2028 election ( https://abcnews.go.com/538/trump-cancel-2028-election-weaken-democracy/story?id=117807079 ). The CLC has a plan to fight for democracy during Trump’s second term ( https://campaignlegal.org/update/clcs-plan-fight-democracy-second-trump-era ).

Dear [Representative’s Name],

I am writing as a gravely concerned citizen. Our nation is nearing a point of no return. Elon Musk now controls the Treasury payment system and could withhold funding for life-saving programs. If we do nothing, people will die.

The rule of law is collapsing. Every day, our institutions are erroding. Catastrophe is on the horizon if the current course of action proceeds unchecked.

I urge you to act immediately using every legal tool and emergency measure available. Specifically:

Challenge federal overreach in court – State Attorneys General must immediately file lawsuits and injunctions to block unconstitutional actions threatening financial stability, elections, and democracy itself.

Refuse cooperation with unlawful federal directives – State agencies and law enforcement must decline participation in unconstitutional federal actions.

Launch a Blue-State Emergency Response – Democrat-led states must form a unified legal &amp; financial coalition to resist federal overreach, including:

A joint legal defense fund to fight federal abuses.

State-level emergency protections for elections, democracy, and economic stability.

Prepare for emergency powers if necessary to protect residents from further harm.

This is not partisan—it’s survival. The time for half-measures is over. I beg you to act now before it’s too late. The entire nation is counting on bold leadership.

GreatPumpkin72,"Building our alternate media empire, a necessary step","I am a former print journalist, so I have seen the decline of both television and local media into partisan hackery.

Our local newspaper, which employed 250 people when I started in the 1990s, now has a handful of employees who cannot cover the community. Local television news is equally hamstrung.

At the national level, Fox News, podcasters, social media, and TikTok have replaced what used to be balanced nightly news coverage, newspapers, and print magazines. These sources have totally coopted what used to be the traditional media space and have been essential in Conservative viewpoints taking over the media landscape.

Some sources -- the Associated Press, Reuters, and several other traditional offerings -- still offer value, though I fear they are little read or consumed. In the public square, we have a few still-popular media spaces; however, most focus on delivering news comedically. The Daily Show still reigns supreme in this regard, though Jon Oliver gives it a run for its money just about any day. Colbert and some others still have their place, but they are mainly preaching to the choir. And as Jon Stewart's recent ""chill out dudes, it ain't fascism \*yet\*""  rant shows, they are all not always capable or trustworthy allies.

Therefore, for the left to succeed in delivering its message effectively, we must work to create the alternative media landscape Republicans and the Far Right have so effectively crafted. We are behind. Far, far, far, behind.

ExtentEfficient2669,"Trump’s plan: make it harder for his opponents, but not necessarily easier for his supporters","Discussion:

During his tenure, Trump has aggressively pursued policies that hurt his opponents while primarily benefiting wealthy elites and corporations and leaving his rural, low-income, and working-class supporters behind. His tax cuts overwhelmingly favored the rich and large businesses, while providing little long-term relief for middle and low income Americans. His administration’s rollback of environmental protections benefited fossil fuel companies but led to increased pollution in rural and industrial areas, disproportionately harming working-class communities and POC. While he claimed to fight for American jobs, his trade wars hurt farmers and small businesses, many of whom supported him but suffered from lost markets and increased costs. His attacks on the Affordable Care Act and cuts to social programs disproportionately affected low-income voters, including many in the MAGA movement, who rely on Medicaid, food assistance, and disability benefits. Meanwhile, his deregulation of industries, opposition to minimum wage increases, and support for corporate interests have made it harder for working class Americans to earn a living wage. Overall, Trump’s policies have strengthened the wealth and power of corporations and the ultra-rich while leaving many of his most loyal supporters struggling with stagnant wages, rising healthcare costs, and worsening economic inequality. So,this leaves me to understand that Trump’s overarching plan is not to strengthen the Republican Party or even Christian ideology, it is to make life extremely difficult for Democrats, those that oppose far-right policies, and anyone else who challenges him. Some people just like to see the world burn.

bigelow6698,The Republican party appears to be becoming less homophobic.,"In 2020, the supreme court ruled that employment discrimination against gay people is unconstitutional. The reason behind this decision was as follows. If a man, who is in a relationship with another man, is subject to employment discrimination because he is in a relationship with a man, but a woman can be in a relationship with a man without facing any such discrimination, that is gender discrimination. Republican justices John Roberts and Neil Gorsuch (who were appointed by George W Bush and Donald Trump respectively) voted with the majority. Two Republican justices voted in favor of gay rights. 

Open a US history textbook and you may notice a trend that has occurred over the past 150 years. There is a group of people (women, gay people, racial minorities, etc.) who do not enjoy the same rights and protections under the law as others. There is controversy there. The issue really is as simple as; one side of the debate says that this group should enjoy the same rights and opportunities as everyone else, the other side believes that that group of people should be treated as second class citizens. The latter group’s entire argument is it is good when X group does it but yucky when Y group does it. The controversy really is as simple as that. When this happens, usually; A few people to the left of the political spectrum speak up and advocate for this positive change, but it seems unlikely that this change will ever occur. Year after year, more and more people on the political left not only advocate for it but attend marches and hold protests. Eventually, pretty much everyone on the left supports giving equal rights to this marginalized group, and the right is deeply divided on whether or not these people should enjoy equal rights. Decades later, we have reached a point where the vast majority of people (barring a very small minority of people) agree that the right in question should be granted to all people. It is amazing to most of us that this was ever controversial. 

Here are a few examples of what I mean. 

When the constitution was first ratified, women could not vote. Around the late 19th and early 20th century, a small minority of people began to entertain the thought that maybe women should vote. Most people (even women themselves) believed otherwise. Some people worried that women were too emotional to vote. To that I say; who is to say that being emotional automatically means that any vote you cast will be misguided. Some people felt that every woman would just vote the same as her husband. Not only is there a fairly decent chance that at least some women (maybe even a lot of women) would not vote the same way as their husbands, this argument fails to consider that unmarried people might vote. The social custom where women and children were to be the first ones rescued in a disaster was created to fuel the idea that women do not need to vote, because men will always prioritise women’s interests when voting. To that I say, women could also prioritize men’s best interests when voting. After all, every man who has ever voted would not have been able to vote if his mother had not given him life. Besides, women bring a unique perspective that men are not capable of bringing and vice versa. Even if men prioritize women’s best interests when voting, there may be certain things these men did not consider that a woman may have been more likely to consider. When the 19th amendment was ratified, a lot of people were mad about it. Nowadays, the vast majority of people agree that women should be allowed to vote. In fact, it seems kind of surprising that anyone would ever be against letting women vote. 

Throughout the first half of the 20th century, black where were oppressed by Jim Crow laws and other racist policies. In the supreme court case known as Plessey V Ferguson, it was ruled that, things that are for black people and things that are for white people could be separate, but they had to be equal. The problem of course is that a lot of the time, they where not equal. If you had one restaurant for whites and another for colored people, the bathrooms in the white restaurants would be cleaner, the cooks in the white restaurant would be more skilled and experienced, etc. Apparently, if a black man had just used the bathroom, there is something wrong with it. If a white man uses that same bathroom, the white man will become infected with the black man’s germs. My thought process is this. If we allow separate but equal, there is a chance that the equal part will not be enforced very diligently. Therefore, in order to justify your belief in separate but equal, you must explain what is wrong with allowing whites and colored people to eat at the same restaurant or sit next to one another on the bus. Whatever terrible thing it is that will happen to a white person who sits next to a black person on the bus, will that same bad thing happen to a white person who sits next to another white person on the bus? If you say no, how do you figure? Plessey V Ferguson was overturned in a case known as Brown V Board of Education. These days, most of us are amazed that anyone would think that a white person using the same public restroom as a black person is inherently harmful. 

Fifty years ago, most Americans felt that gay people should not be allowed to marry and adopt. Now, pretty much everyone who considers themselves liberal, is in favor of extending full equal rights to homosexuals. The percentage of Republicans, who oppose gay rights, is becoming smaller by the year. 

Fifty years from now, I am confident that those who oppose gay marriage will be seen the same way that people who oppose inter racial marriage are seen today. These people will still exist, but they will be a small minority of people and most of us will be amazed that anyone is or ever has been opposed to same sex marriage. After all, the purpose of laws is to protect people from harm. That is not to say that, just because a behavior has the potential to harm people, that it should necessarily be illegal. However, only if a behavior is potentially harmful should it be illegal. Any and all behaviors that do not have the potential to harm people should be legal. Therefore, laws stating that marriage licenses can only be issued to opposite sex couples and cannot be issued to same sex couples is fundamentally illogical for the same reason that it would be illogical to have a law prohibiting wearing a green shirt in public all the while it is totally legal to wear a red shirt in public. Anything (whether it be good, bad or neutral) that could happen as a result of wearing a green shirt in public, could also happen if you wear a red shirt in public. Therefore, if the situation and context is such that you are allowed to wear a red shirt in public, then you should be allowed to wear a green shirt in public. Similarly, anything (good, bad or neutral) that could happen if a same sex couple gets married, could also happen if a sterile heterosexual couple gets married. I added the qualifier that we are talking specifically about sterile heterosexual unions, because same sex unions are 100% sterile, while heterosexual unions do in fact carry with them the potential to create new life. If being sterile does not preclude you from marrying someone of the opposite sex and/or adopting a child, then same sex couples should also be allowed to marry and adopt.

DonkeyBonked,Taxpayers Are Getting Fleeced: Why Aren't Our Tax Dollars Treated Like Investments?,"**Why is it that when taxpayers fund billion-dollar corporations, we don’t get a single cent back, but when corporations make billions off our investment, they pay zero in taxes?**

**Why Aren’t Public Funds Treated as Investments?**

Every year, billions of taxpayer dollars are poured into private enterprises, massive corporate bailouts, infrastructure projects, pharmaceutical research, Hollywood film productions, and sports stadiums, the list goes on. The justification? ""Economic stimulation,"" ""job creation,"" or ""public benefit."" But here’s the problem: while the corporations receiving this funding reap enormous profits, taxpayers see little to no direct return on their investment. Most of the time, we're left footing the bill while public programs are struggling to keep afloat.

If the government is acting as an investor, then why isn’t the public receiving dividends, equity stakes, or proportional profits? Why is taxpayer money being handed out with zero expectation of financial returns?

This should not be a partisan issue. It’s not socialism, as I know many would call it, nor do I see it as radical. It’s basic investment logic. And yet, in every major taxpayer-funded venture, the public is consistently left holding the bill while corporations rake in billions.

**The Math Behind Social Security: An Avoidable Crisis**

What really sparked this topic for me was a discussion I was having with my wife about Social Security, one of the most glaring examples of our broken system. Right now, there is a cap on how much income is subject to Social Security tax ($176,100 in 2025). This means that someone earning $176,100 pays the exact same amount into Social Security as someone making $1 million, $10 million, or even $100 million.

Logically, if this cap were removed, high earners would contribute proportionally to their income, and Social Security's funding crisis would largely disappear. In fact, estimates suggest that simply taxing all income equally would extend Social Security's solvency for decades.

So why don’t we do it? Because those with the most political influence, high earners and corporations, have successfully lobbied to keep this system in place, ensuring that the burden falls disproportionately on middle- and lower-income workers.

Originally, Social Security was supposed to function more like a long-term investment fund rather than a pay-as-you-go system. The original design intended for it to accumulate funds and generate returns over time. Instead, the money was immediately spent on benefits, and as a result, we've been funding it through new contributions rather than investment growth.

Had we followed the originally intended formula, instead of having certain global investment firms with trillions of dollars in investment capital driving up inflation, we'd have Social Security invested in our economy, with that return ensuring future generations would be able to retire without worrying that they'll have to work until they're gone.

**Where Public Money Goes, and Who Profits**

The problem isn’t just Social Security. Taxpayer money is funneled into countless private enterprises with little to no accountability for returns. Here are just a few examples:

1. **Corporate Bailouts:** During the 2008 financial crisis, the government bailed out banks with $700 billion in taxpayer money. Those banks quickly recovered and became massively profitable again, but did the public receive a return on their forced investment? No. The banks pocketed the profits, paid out executive bonuses, and then raised fees on the customers who paid for their bailout. This doesn't even count the car company bailouts or any of the other numerous other companies saved by taxpayer money.
2. **Big Pharma and Government-Funded Research:** Many of the world’s most profitable drugs were developed using taxpayer-funded research. Once these drugs hit the market, pharmaceutical companies slap on astronomical price tags. The public, who funded the research, not only has to pay full price, but these companies often hike up prices on drugs they know that Medicare and Medicaid will pay for. Why aren’t these investments structured like venture capital deals, where the government retains a percentage of profits? You could probably fund Medicare with just fair dividends from the drugs taxpayers have paid to research.
3. **Hollywood and Publicly Funded Productions:** Millions of taxpayer dollars go into film tax credits, military-funded productions, and subsidized studio infrastructure. Yet when a film makes hundreds of millions in profit, does the government receive a percentage? Absolutely not. Imagine if taxpayers had a stake in every blockbuster they funded proportionate to the tax dollars used to produce the film.
4. **Stadium Construction:** A Perpetual Public Loss: Cities routinely shell out hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars to build sports stadiums under the false promise of ""economic growth."" In reality, these projects generate mostly low-wage jobs with little tax revenue to justify the expense. Many of the employees at these stadiums make so little that they end up on Medicaid and food stamps, so I highly doubt even the few jobs they produce manage to create a positive tax flow. Meanwhile, team owners, often billionaires, profit immensely, and then a few decades later, demand new taxpayer-funded stadiums. Instead of this endless cycle, why aren’t cities demanding ownership stakes in these franchises? It would be a better benefit to taxpayers if these downtown stadiums were used to build parking lots instead. I'm not saying we shouldn't have sports teams, but if we're funding the stadiums, and they have enough money to sign enormous contracts with athletes (recently I saw one that was almost a billion dollars for one player), then why on earth is there not enough money to repay the cost of the stadium, at a bare minimum?

A Simple, Fair Solution: Treat Public Spending Like Investment Capital

If a venture capital firm invests in a startup, they get equity. If a bank loans money, they demand collateral. If the government (taxpayers) funds a project, why is there no expectation of a financial return?

**A fair public investment strategy would include:**

* **Profit Shares:** If public money funds 20% of a business, the public should receive 20% of its net profits.
* **Stock Ownership:** If taxpayer dollars bail out a corporation, the government should receive equity.
* Dividends for Public Programs: Profits from publicly funded projects should be reinvested into Social Security, Medicare, and public infrastructure, not funneled into executive bonuses.

I absolutely do not see this as government overreach; I see it as just common sense. Taxpayers should expect the same returns on investment that any private investor would demand. Taxpayer-funded programs have contributed greatly to the corporate side of the economy, why is it acceptable that our tax dollars become their paychecks while very few of them contribute anything in the way of taxes?

**Why This Hasn’t Happened, and How We Change It**

The only reason this system persists is because corporations have structured public spending to their advantage. Lobbyists ensure that taxpayer money keeps flowing with no strings attached, while politicians, many of whom engage in a form of legal insider trading, benefit directly from protecting corporate interests.

**But this conversation needs to happen. Americans deserve to ask:**

* Why are we funding billion-dollar corporations with no expectation of return?
* Why do politicians resist removing the Social Security tax cap when it could fix the program's funding crisis?
* Why are taxpayer-funded investments structured as giveaways instead of long-term public assets?
* Why do we give money to corporations that don't pay taxes and are run by executives who also don't pay taxes when they give themselves the money we used to bail them out?

If we demand accountability in public spending, we could transform Social Security, fund public programs without increasing taxes, and finally break the cycle of corporate welfare disguised as economic policy.

It’s time to start treating public investment like what it actually is: **an investment.**

Let's face the truth, these corporations rarely pay taxes. There are so many tax loopholes out there that we dump billions of dollars into corporations that, at the end of the year, pay less taxes than the average employee at their own company.

Taking an equity stake in public investments is likely the only way taxpayers will ever see any return on public investment. It's important to recognize that we're in deficit spending, which means every dollar of corporate welfare is money we don't even have. Why do we allow our children and grandchildren to be born into debt, ensuring executives are guaranteed generations of wealth for theirs?

Personally, I'm sick of promises to tax the rich that, in the end, just end up creating inflation we pay for everywhere, from the pump to the grocery store. This is the only way I see corporations ever actually paying their fair share without it becoming just another expense that they will add their profit margins to and dump right back on us to pay for them.

How much of Wall Street has been funded by taxpayers, but only the wealthiest people and politicians make anything off it? Imagine if those companies had publicly appointed representatives on their boards, similar to how government-funded agencies operate!

How much of our infrastructure was taxpayer-funded, but corporations make all the money off it?

I'm sure many people can give countless more examples of taxpayer investments where the public saw no return.

Doesn't this seem like something that could be framed as a net positive for enough people on both sides of the aisle to make it happen (eventually)?

brewin91,Why Do Conservatives Hate America?,"They’re broadly supporting policies that will ruin American companies, cost Americans their jobs, and force Americans to pay more for goods and services. They support attacking our allies and opening up avenues for China to replace us in the global trade system. For a group whose motto is “Make America Great Again”, why do they consistently support policies aimed at crippling United States? 

Trump’s tariffs are the biggest tax on American consumers since the 1940’s. It will cost the average American at least $1,000 dollars per year in consumption taxes, without accounting for retaliatory effects. We are both reducing our food supply workforce via deportation (even of legal citizens) and taxing the food supply via tariffs. A double whammy on price increases and inflation. Not to mention, he randomly poured out a large portion of California’s water supply for quite literally no reason, depleting the water available for our farmers this summer for irrigation. 

Canada is our countries biggest supplier of energy. We are taxing that, too. We are taxing CANADA more than CHINA, who is the best positioned country to supplant us in global trade with both Canada and the EU. We are releasing cop beaters back into society and providing an unelected, non-government official in Elon Musk (who has significant business with and in China) with our private citizen’s information on banking and addresses.

Trump has spent two weeks focused explicitly on crippling the American economy, reducing our access to goods and services, making the ones we do have access to more expensive, and ensuring that things only get much worse from here. Conservatives meanwhile are whining and crying about Democrats, DEI, and people wanting to keep their bills down.

So I am 23f (gen z) and I feel like so many people in my generation all of a sudden became heavy republicans in this past election (I get this from pretty much every interaction I have with people my age in real life as well as online). I get it, a lot of us only just entered the adult world post-pandemic (I graduated college and moved out July 2023) so we only really know a world where we can’t afford anything, but I genuinely thought my generation was wayyyy more open to diversity, promoting human rights, health initiatives, etc. than our parents (usually gen x). Lately though, i’ve noticed tons more people my age wanting to go back to “traditional” (🚩🚩🚩) mindsets.

 I get it to an extent. Seeing that things probably wont improve is tiring, especially when you have little life experience to turn to for hope that things will get better. it’s kind of like looking into the future and seeing a never ending hopeless pit. It would be nice to have the ability to choose whether or not I want to live a “traditional” life  (in my case it would be one partner stays at home with our future kids while the other works) rather than having to work three jobs between my husband and i to pay off student loans and cost of living (i have a bachelor’s and am a nurse and he is a fireman. we also just live in an apartment and don’t go out or anything) with little to no savings. 

HOWEVER, i do NOT understand why they think mass deportations, tariffs, taking away SO MANY people’s rights, and giving literally horrible people who only have their own best interests in mind all the power would help AT ALL. Literally the only thing it’s destined to do is make our situation MUCH worse. Plus so many people forgot how most of this was caused by the pandemic.

ChampionshipNo5707,Trump Blames Immigrants for Housing Prices—But His Own Policies Fueled the Surge,"These are my thoughts on Trumps impact on the housing market surge:

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 introduced a one-time mandatory repatriation tax on foreign earnings of U.S. corporations, leading to the repatriation of approximately $777 billion in 2018. This influx of capital resulted in significant share buybacks and dividend distributions, providing substantial windfalls for investors. Many reinvested these gains into investment real estate, fueling a buying frenzy that contributed to rapid property price increases. Additionally, the number of investment properties and Airbnb listings surged, further intensifying competition in the housing market.

During President Trump's tenure, the gross federal debt increased by about $7.8 trillion, rising from $19.95 trillion to $27.75 trillion. 

[crfb.org](https://www.crfb.org/blogs/how-much-did-president-trump-add-debt?utm_source=chatgpt.com)This increase was due in part to the TCJA and subsequent fiscal policies, including COVID-19 relief measures.

Despite these factors, former President Trump has attributed the rise in housing market prices solely to increased immigration, overlooking the significant impact of policies enacted during his administration. 

Trump’s millionaire and billionaire friends have expanded their real estate empires while the average American struggles to afford a home—if they can at all. Instead, we’re left renting from the 1%.

50501 is planning on protesting in capitals, where they hope to be seen and heard by legislators I’m guessing. 

——

Some questions:

Cities remain largely liberal. Rural areas aren’t. What actual impact does protesting in a city have when the people there already largely agree? 

What impact does protesting in front of a capital have when a lot of those legislators don’t have to go to work, aren’t voted in from that area, and just wait it out? 

——

I’m recommending a change of tactics. 

Guerrilla protesting rural areas.  Why not? Conservative agitators often go to cities to cause issues. They aren’t always from those cities.

Gold has been a cornerstone of economic stability for centuries—tangible, trusted, and immune to the wild volatility that defines cryptocurrency. Bitcoin may be trendy, but it’s speculative and unproven as a reserve asset. Trading gold for crypto undermines the financial security of the nation and risks shaking global confidence in the dollar. What’s baffling is the silence from the political right, which has always championed gold as sound money, and Democrats should be just as alarmed—this isn’t bold leadership, it’s a dangerous gamble with America’s future.",279,0.97,54,1738454681,Liberal

His claims that putting tariffs on Canadian oil will lower the price of gas because we will using our own, instead of buying theirs. Our refineries are setup to convert heavy dirty crude oil that we buy at a cheaper price. We sell our light sweet crude oil to other nation's that have refineries setup to convert light sweet crude into fuels. We buy cheaper crude oil and sell higher priced crude oil. It would take billions of dollars for the US to convert our refineries over to convert  from heavy crude to light crude. This issue should have been taken into consideration before he started messing with it. We will soon be paying a dollar or two more very soon for a gallon of gas. Plus we buy a lot of natural gas. Different natural gas has different chemistry. Again it is why we buy natural gas and sell ours. But natural gas is as not a big issue as liquid fuels. ",282,0.96,59,1738448133,Liberal

This administration, lives, breathes, and thrives off of that wretched network. It's the highest rated news network in the country. Literally every right wing politician in the country contributes to it. The best way to stop a troll is to not give it any fuel for the fire. And a lot of their hosts do nothing but trash other talk shows and anything else that doesn't fit Murdoch's mold. 

The simple fact of the matter is that Fox News is poison. It has rotted as many if not more minds than the most dangerous street drugs out there. Doesn't matter which of their obnoxious hosts -  if it's Hannity, Gutfeld, Ingraham, Baritromo, and so on, they're just trolls. They just feed and thrive off misery and chaos - particularly ours. And the people they promote and get elected are nothing more than glorified content creators for that channel. Hell, since taking office last Monday, Trump has been on that channel like 5 times in the last week. Vance has been on it almost every day. And everyone else connected to that administration is on it daily.

So the best way to starve a troll - don't give them any fuel for the fire. Turn off Fox. Just turn it off.

She works in global health and development. 2ish days ago they froze all foreign aid funding for an audit. Audits are normal but freezing it in the meantime is not. Not only that, they froze funding that was already allocated/promised. Nonprofits will spend that money on credit as soon as it’s allocated meaning several are already folding and declaring bankruptcy. Almost everyone she knows in the field have been laid off or put on leave.

Luckily my parents are moving to London for a few years in the next month and she’ll be able to get a job there that’s not affected by the US government but this freeze means employees in other countries—many of whom are the breadwinners for their families—are abruptly out of work.

Vance is more competent and seems more closely aligned with Project 2025 than Trump, but he doesn't have the popularity Trump does with the public and perhaps not with Trump's allies.

[deleted],LinkedIn Protest and Action,"Please consider participating in a protest on LinkedIn.  LinkedIn hosts an international mixed audience with influence and money.  Corporate, government, and religious bodies are exposed.  A considerable fraction of its users are sympathetic.  Over the past few days I did a test run and had some success.  I did not see much concurrent resistance activity but there is quite a bit of existing political discussion.

I began with my authentic LinkedIn profile.  I have worked as a US engineer for a few companies and had around 500 contacts.  I do not think LinkedIn is particularly useful for career purposes and have not been very active.

I believe my most successful tactic was targeting company posts.  As an example, many companies with millions of followers made posts “celebrating” MLK Jr. day.  On these I commented “Company Name CEO Name, what is your opinion on Musk’s Nazi salute?”  I then liked the company post and reposted it to my account with the same comment as a description.

I also commented on a few corporate disclosures.  As an example, a Germany company posted a video where the CEO talked about political changes improving business prospects.  I wrote something about these policies being similar to those of the AfD and asked whether he supported Elon Musk’s salute.  I happened to be the first commenter and believe many people saw this.  Individuals with inside and industry knowledge could gather considerable attention in this way.

I interacted with both conservative and progressive commenters.  Many of my statements were upvoted or argued.  I am not sure how effective this was but it is somewhat visible.

I posted a few news articles.  I am not sure how effective this is because it was hard to get impressions.

A few people complained that my behavior was not work appropriate but I think most users are in favor of free speech.

Over about three days I accumulated about 300 profile views and 4000 impressions.  Some very influential people with job titles like VP and Chief Communications Officer viewed my profile.  People from all over the world viewed my profile.  A royal liked one of my comments.  Women seemed particularly sympathetic and courageous.  This was a test run and I am not particularly well versed in social media.

It is possible to directly post articles, videos, and Reddit content.  I think it is possible to generate fake accounts with nothing more than an email.  Someone named Elon Musk with a picture of Elon Musk liked a comment.

This morning I woke up to find that my account had been suspended.  It took them 3 days to do this and I suspect they can be overwhelmed.  The email indicates that this is due to potential identity theft.  I was asked to provide images of government identification to restore access.  I do not know if my account will be restored.

I also received one warning for hate speech.  This warning threatened potential account suspension.  I had written “Fuck Trump.”  I do not think this is hate speech.  This comment was up for something like 1.5 days before I received the warning.  Using language like fascist and Nazi may or may not be recommended but I was very aggressive.

I understand many people are hesitant to participate due to exposure at their job.  It was very difficult to get upvotes from my network.  I am not sure how many of my previous contacts were online but only one person had the courage to like an article that I posted.

Thank you for taking the time to read this.  If you like this idea please help distribute it across Reddit and anywhere else.  I have been a Reddit lurker for about 3 years but have limited karma and am unable to make my own standalone post.",1,0.53,6,1738083608,Liberal

DatAspie2000,Something that isn’t talked about enough,"How insane it is that Trump is president again. 

The biggest focal point here is January 6th. He was impeached a second time for that and had been convicted of crimes. And conservatives still wanted him and only him out of all the republican candidates. Also, for a party that preaches law and order, where’s the law and order in even letting Trump run again? I’m also looking at you, SCOTUS for giving Trump immunity. 

Society somehow doesn’t think it’s messed up that you could be convicted of felonies and be eligible to hold the highest office. There’s no standards for how presidents are as people anymore. It’s to the point that me posting this in any sub not dedicated to liberals would at least lead to some comments about how stupid I am.

Democratic politicians set a good example during the vote counting process by not disputing the election results nor telling people to “fight like hell”, telling them “if you don’t fight, we’re not gonna have a country anymore”, etc.

People would say “well, look at what this former President did and what that President did”. Has any president or presidential candidate ever strongly and so openly disputed election results, then told their supporters to storm the capitol, which led to their own VP almost being killed????

I blindly assumed that Trump was done for after J6 because I thought the law would take care of him. Well, in a way they did, but he somehow was still allowed to run again and he still got just as much support as he did 8 years ago.

MantaRay2256,Remember the right wing 2009 TEA Party?  Liberals need something just like that!,"Remember the right wing 2009 TEA Party protests? TEA=Taxed Enough Already. FOX News constantly pushed the refrain that Obama would raise taxes to finance Obamacare -and that he wouldn't raise taxes on his rich friends. The right went crazy. The midterms were a bloodbath.  TEA partiers ran for office everywhere - and did REALLY well.

The name, TEA Party, was genius because it linked so nicely to the Boston Tea Party.  I'm not smart enough to think up something similar - but certainly someone in the Reddit world is.

The TEA party was all about reining in presidential power and government in general.  Every time Obama signed an executive order, the right went freaking nuts.

'Up' is now officially 'down.'  We should be taking advantage of that!

**Edit to add:**  Lots of ""But this..."" and ""But that..."" replies.  However, this post has 90% approval.  This isn't a perfect idea - but we seem to agree that SOMETHING effective needs to happen.

**How about ""The King movement""?**  It came to me after monkeyangst pointed out that MAGA folks misspell ""rein in"" as ""reign in.""  We could literally use it.

""King"" links us to Dr. MLK Jr. - who created great change peacefully.  It also reminds people that if we don't do something quick, we are doomed to be ruled by the rich.  

Amconmichael pointed out that the TEA Party was really an anti Black president party.   I agree.  Their stated purpose was to push back against too much government power.  We have the same stated purpose, but technically, we would be an anti orange president party.  

brodievonorchard pointed out that the TEA Party was quickly astroturfed by the oil baron Koch bro pricks.  True - and Big Oil is still big shit - but if the TEA Party's true purpose was to thwart a Black president, then didn't that exact scenario just happen?  

Fitz\_2112b points out that the TEA Party morphed into MAGA - which is now a face-eating leopard oligarchy.  True.  Are we saying that with the threat of astroturfing and leopard-face-eating, maybe we shouldn't go there?

It seems like AOC and Buttigieg are the only Democrats who know how to talk to the media. 

I don’t think AOC would be a good candidate in 2028. Maybe someday she’ll be president, but first I’d like to see her win a statewide election. 

I don’t love Buttigieg, but he could be an okay option. I like that his experience includes the white house and the military. I don’t like McKinsey, but he has mostly washed off the stink of that by now. I don’t like that the highest elected office he’s held is mayor. 

Anybody else who wants to be president needs to get their name out there. They need to be on CNN, The Daily Show, The Late Show, the View, SNL, Youtube shows, and podcasts. They each need to brainstorm a few dozen memorable one-liners that summarize their positions, and then say all of them in public until one of them sticks. 

They need to step slightly left of their comfort zone. I’m not suggesting that they should take a far-left stance on all of the issues, but they each need to have one leftist viewpoint that distinguishes them from Nancy Pelosi. 

I’ll gladly admit to my own ignorance. I have no idea what the following people are doing or saying right now: Josh Shapiro, Gretchen Whitmer, Mark Kelly, or Cory Booker. I don’t even know who Ruben Gallego, JB Pritzker, or Wes Moore are (I found their names in a Newsweek article). The thing is that most voters are at least as ignorant as I am.

 But ... We aren't out numbered at all.

By the numbers ... 
US Population - 335 million

Roughly: 73 million people under the age of 18 
Roughly: 160 million registered voters in the country

Total votes cast in 2024: 152.3 million (8 million didn't show up) 

Trump won by 2.2 million

So! 
335 million people minus those under 18 ...
Minus the people who did vote is ... 

That's about 100 million people who are eligible to but not registered to vote.

That means, there are approx 108 million people right there who arent registered, active or paying attention. And you KNOW of those 108 million ... They're certainly not ALL Trump supporters. 

And - 77ish million people voted from Trump. That number is a scant 23% of our total population. It's still too high of course, but let me say that again ... TWENTY-THREE PER CENT. 

So take heart! All is not lost and we are NOT out umbered. The media wants us to think we are doomed. We absolutely are not. BUT ... Somehow the folks who have tuned it all out need to be activated somehow. 

Frankly ... I'm daring to have a modicum of hope for mid-terms ... But it is gonna be a long fucking two years!

In4thelongrun_,the new era of self-education,"TLDR: what are some of the most impactful books you've read that debunked the myths you were told in school?

with Trump changing course syllabi,  I have never felt more strongly about the power of self-education.

more than ever, I feel it is my duty to read books, books from those of us who are outliers in society, those of us who tell history, not as *his story* but as a true and full story of the events that unfolded.

the things we learn in schools, they are not a be-all end-all of knowledge. the breadth and depth of the things we learn in school is widely censored, carefully scripted to fit the narratives of the board of directors and institution administrators, many of whom are conservative in their own right.

there were many myths i learned in school that took time to debunk. and the debunking did not come from textbook history books. they came from independent historians with a vision to share the truth, the whole truth, the good, the bad, the ugly.

PS. 

The Angel who arrived to share the joyous news of Jesus Christ's birth chose to appear in front of a group of shepherds, who at the time were outcasts, cursed to the outskirts of the city where they tended their flocks and slept under the night sky.

even though Jesus had arrived to save the world, he was born in a lowly manger, birthed in a bed of hay.  he spent his life healing the weak and uplifting the poor, the disenfranchised, the ones marginalized from society. 

so many of our leaders, leaders who threaten to take away rights, freeze or fire jobs, and allow the destruction of corporate greed to degrade the planet, use Christianity as the flame for their fire. 

and perhaps many of us voted in thinking they stood for the ideologies they preached. but its only after I read the Bible, as someone not born into Christianity, having never gone to church, or communion, that I understood Jesus' mission. thats the power of self-education. 

BTW. im only using Jesus here because many of us are Christian and may relate better to his story. But I've also enjoyed reading texts from the Bhagavad Gita, Qu'ran, Pali Cannon, and Torah.",4,0.65,5,1737848245,Liberal

HumanistRuth,Reactionary nihilism of right-wing politics risks catastrophe,"You don’t have to be an engineer to grasp how a gargantuan construction can disintegrate in a flash.

[Adam Gabbatt reports](https://www.alternet.org/katherine-stewart-oligarchs/) on Katherine Stewart’s forthcoming book, [***Money, Lies, and God: Inside the Movement to Destroy American Democracy***](https://search.worldcat.org/title/1429656500). One section of his report is terrifyingly profound.

Stewart describes “‘**reactionary nihilism**’...  reactionary in the sense that it expresses itself as mortal opposition to a perceived catastrophic change in the political order; it is nihilistic because its deepest **premise is that the actual world is devoid of value, impervious to reason**, and governable only through brutal acts of will…. It stands for a kind of unraveling of the American political mind — a madness that now afflicts one side of nearly every political debate.”

Widespread embrace of that nihilistic premise should terrify anyone capable of looking at our global society through the eyes of an engineer. Watch the TV show “Engineering Catastrophes.” A bad glue job on a train engine camshaft can lead to half of a town being burned to the ground. One loose bolt or dropped wrench can inexorably result in the collapse of bridge formwork or in a missile silo explosion. Engineers learn that with big builds, even the tiniest incorrect detail can lead to catastrophe.

Our current fossil fuel civilization is more intricate and interconnected than any bridge, plane, or high rise.

They will now, but they were allowed to vote their fears and prejudices because they faced no consequences. We (liberal) talked a good game on social media, but did we do anything. Meaning, we all have friends/family members who overtly supported trump.

Often, we try to convert or talk someone into doing something different, and this is one time when converting is not possible, and trying to, may be wasting time, and people continued what they did, knowing they would not lose friends or family.

Legitimate_Ad_4620,Contradictory Conservatives: A Call for Reflection,"
I’m not deeply entrenched in politics, nor do I hate conservatives or MAGA supporters as a group. I prefer to judge individuals based on their character and actions. That said, I’ve observed what feels like a significant transformation within the conservative movement over the past 16 years.

In the 2000s, the Republican Party seemed to stand on foundational principles—issues like abortion, gun control, government overreach, and border security. These principles, while debatable, were often presented with a degree of respect and thoughtfulness. The rise of Trump, however, ushered in a new era of conservatism. It feels more aggressive, less tethered to intellectual consistency, and more pervasive in our daily lives, thanks in part to platforms like YouTube, TikTok, Facebook, and Instagram.

This increased exposure has prompted me to examine conservative ideologies more critically, alongside their liberal counterparts. Through logical reasoning and exploring potential contradictions, I’ve identified some striking paradoxes within the modern conservative movement. While these aren’t novel insights, I hope to open a dialogue for further exploration and understanding.

The Pro-Life Paradox

Conservatives frequently champion a zero-tolerance approach to abortion. They argue that life begins at conception and that a fetus, regardless of development stage, has an inalienable right to life. For many, this belief is rooted in a sincere desire to protect innocent life. On its surface, this seems noble, even compelling. Most people, regardless of political affiliation, would agree that late-term abortions—except in extreme cases—should be restricted.

Yet, conservatives apply this logic inconsistently. If the moral imperative to protect life is so absolute, why is there no parallel outcry to address the leading cause of death among children and teenagers in the U.S.—guns? Conservatives cling to the Second Amendment as if it’s untouchable, yet their unwillingness to consider even modest reforms stands in stark contrast to their self-professed commitment to protecting life.

This inconsistency deepens when we examine their position on the future of the very fetuses they fight to save. Imagine a fetus they protect today grows up into a woman facing an unwanted pregnancy—perhaps due to assault, health risks, or financial instability. The same conservatives who fought for her right to be born would now deny her autonomy, forcing her to carry a pregnancy to term, regardless of the consequences.

If the pro-life movement truly values life, why isn’t there a push for universal pre-K, affordable childcare, or free school lunch programs? Where is the investment in the well-being of American youth? Instead, we see an intense focus on banning drag show readings while programs that directly benefit children languish.

This raises the question: do conservatives truly value life, or is their interest in protecting the unborn merely a means to exert control over personal freedoms?

The Trump Contradiction

Trump’s presidency and influence have brought contradictions within the conservative movement into sharp focus. For instance, conservatives cheered Trump’s recent executive order to repeal electric vehicle mandates, celebrating his commitment to oil and gas. Yet, the advisor he tapped for this initiative is the CEO of the world’s largest electric vehicle manufacturer. How does this align with their narrative?

Consider Trump’s actions on TikTok. In 2020, he signed an executive order to ban the app, citing national security concerns over Chinese ownership. Conservatives rallied behind him, lauding his toughness on China. Fast forward to today, and TikTok’s reinstatement is celebrated as a victory for free speech. Conveniently forgotten is Trump’s role in the original ban, as is the fact that a major American investor in TikTok is one of his donors.

The contradictions extend to immigration, one of Trump’s hallmark issues. In February 2024, a bipartisan border bill was proposed. The legislation would have tightened asylum standards and automatically secured the border if illegal crossings exceeded certain thresholds. Trump, however, opposed the bill, calling it a “gift to the Democrats.” Following his condemnation, Senate Republicans abandoned it, and the bill failed. Conservatives who revere Trump as the ultimate defender of the border have remained silent about his role in blocking legislation that could have reduced illegal immigration.

The Larger Question

These are just a few examples of what I see as glaring contradictions within the conservative movement. How can conservatives reconcile being pro-life while disregarding the lives of pregnant women, children, and teens killed by gun violence? How do they explain supporting a president whose actions often undermine the very principles they claim to hold dear?

I don’t ask these questions to inflame or mock but to encourage meaningful dialogue. I want to hear from you. Share your thoughts, provide your perspectives, and help deepen this conversation. Perhaps together, we can untangle the inconsistencies and better understand the ideological shifts at play.

TL;DR: Conservatives claim to value life but demonstrate contradictory priorities on abortion, gun control, and support for Trump. Let’s discuss these contradictions and their implications.",3,0.62,4,1737576852,Liberal
Keith502,The Dred Scott case has no relevance to the second amendment,"It’s my understanding that gun advocates sometimes use the 1857 *Dred Scott v. Sandford* ([link](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/60/393/#tab-opinion-1964281)) decision to make the argument that the second amendment guarantees an individual right to own guns.  Just a few examples of 2A advocates making this argument are [this video](https://youtu.be/2W8sppSylVU?si=Nc8sFW1RGujByEjl&amp;t=129), [this video](https://youtu.be/neLdsW7XZSM?si=5wz8HCrInl1s6KCi&amp;t=605), and [this video](https://youtu.be/6vglHW9q2Ek?si=DUs36IP8dXJ6Sp6G&amp;t=101), as well as written examples such as these: [link 1](https://www.independent.org/news/article.asp?id=345),[ link 2](https://www.law.georgetown.edu/mcrp-journal/blog/the-second-amendment-is-racist-why-bruen-should-have-been-decided-on-equal-protection-grounds/),[ link 3](https://harvardlawreview.org/forum/vol-135/racist-gun-laws-and-the-second-amendment/).  In fact, even Justice Clarence Thomas connects *Dred Scott* to the second amendment in his opinion for *NYSRPA vs Bruen* ([link](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/597/20-843/#tab-opinion-4600259)).  Most of their argument seems to stem from this excerpt from the opinion in that case written by Chief Justice Roger Brooke Taney:

&gt;More especially, it cannot be believed that the large slaveholding States regarded them as included in the word citizens, or would have consented to a Constitution which might compel them to receive them in that character from another State. For if they were so received, and entitled to the privileges and immunities of citizens, it would exempt them from the operation of the special laws and from the police regulations which they considered to be necessary for their own safety. **It would give to persons of the negro race, who were recognised as citizens in any one State of the Union, the right to enter every other State whenever they pleased, singly or in companies, without pass or passport, and without obstruction, to sojourn there as long as they pleased, to go where they pleased at every hour of the day or night without molestation, unless they committed some violation of law for which a white man would be punished; and it would give them the full liberty of speech in public and in private upon all subjects upon which its own citizens might speak; to hold public meetings upon political affairs, and to keep and carry arms wherever they went.** And all of this would be done in the face of the subject race of the same color, both free and slaves, and inevitably producing discontent and insubordination among them, and endangering the peace and safety of the State.

The portion I’ve put in bold appears to be what some argue is a synopsis of the federal Bill of Rights, and the statement saying “and to keep and carry arms wherever they went” appears to be a reference to the second amendment.  Gun advocates would argue that if the Supreme Court in 1857 believed that the second amendment guaranteed a citizen an individual right to keep and carry a gun, then this must also have been the traditional and authentic interpretation of that amendment.

However, I don’t understand how this argument is valid.  It seems to me that one could only come to the aforementioned conclusion if one has not actually read the context in which the above paragraph appears.  Earlier, Justice Taney had begun his opinion by presenting a list of state laws which placed explicit restrictions upon the rights and privileges of the black populations of the respective states.  These laws dated from colonial times through to the then-present day.  Taney’s reasoning was essentially that it made no sense for a “negro” that was a slave or a descendant of slaves imported from Africa to become a citizen, because the sum of all of the discriminatory and prohibitive laws that had been passed against the black populations strongly indicates that it had been the general will of the individual states to subjugate the black populations in the interest of public peace and security.  And when the individual states ratified the Constitution in order to join into a union under a federal government, the individual states vested to the federal government the protection of their peace and safety; and thus, it would be inappropriate for the federal government to betray this trust by giving citizenship to a demographic which the individual states themselves had seen fit to subjugate.  

 Among the list of discriminatory laws he mentions, the first is a 1717 law from Maryland which declared

&gt;”that if any free negro or mulatto intermarry with any white woman, or if any white man shall intermarry with any negro or mulatto woman, such negro or mulatto shall become a slave during life, excepting mulattoes born of white women, who, for such intermarriage, shall only become servants for seven years, to be disposed of as the justices of the county court where such marriage so happens shall think fit, to be applied by them towards the support of a public school within the said county. And any white man or white woman who shall intermarry as aforesaid with any negro or mulatto, such white man or white woman shall become servants during the term of seven years, and shall be disposed of by the justices as aforesaid, and be applied to the uses aforesaid.""

 Then he mentions a 1705 Massachusetts law which declared that

&gt;""if any negro or mulatto shall presume to smite or strike any person of the English or other Christian nation, such negro or mulatto shall be severely whipped, at the discretion of the justices before whom the offender shall be convicted.""

 And another law from the same state declares

&gt;""that none of her Majesty's English or Scottish subjects, nor of any other Christian nation, within this province, shall contract matrimony with any negro or mulatto; nor shall any person, duly authorized to solemnize marriage, presume to join any such in marriage, on pain of forfeiting the sum of fifty pounds; one moiety thereof to her Majesty, for and towards the support of the Government within this province, and the other moiety to him or them that shall inform and sue for the same, in any of her Majesty's courts of record within the province, by bill, plaint, or information.""

 He later on mentions a 1774 Connecticut provision

&gt;by which any negro, Indian, or mulatto servant who was found wandering out of the town or place to which he belonged without a written pass such as is therein described was made liable to be seized by anyone, and taken before the next authority to be examined and delivered up to his master -- who was required to pay the charge which had accrued thereby. And a subsequent section of the same law provides that if any free negro shall travel without such pass, and shall be stopped, seized, or taken up, he shall pay all charges arising thereby. And this law was in full operation when the Constitution of the United States was adopted, and was not repealed till 1797. So that, up to that time, free negroes and mulattoes were associated with servants and slaves in the police regulations established by the laws of the State.

 And then another Connecticut law in 1833 which…

&gt;made it penal to set up or establish any school in that State for the instruction of persons of the African race not inhabitants of the State, or to instruct or teach in any such school or institution, or board or harbor for that purpose, any such person without the previous consent in writing of the civil authority of the town in which such school or institution might be.

 Justice Taney mentions a provision in New Hampshire  in 1815, in which

&gt;no one was permitted to be enrolled in the militia of the State but free white citizens, and the same provision is found in a subsequent collection of the laws made in 1855. Nothing could more strongly mark the entire repudiation of the African race. The alien is excluded because, being born in a foreign country, he cannot be a member of the community until he is naturalized. But why are the African race, born in the State, not permitted to share in one of the highest duties of the citizen? The answer is obvious; he is not, by the institutions and laws of the State, numbered among its people. He forms no part of the sovereignty of the State, and is not therefore called on to uphold and defend it.

 And finally he mentions an 1822 Rhode Island law

&gt;forbidding persons who were authorized to join persons in marriage from joining in marriage any white person with any negro, Indian, or mulatto, under the penalty of two hundred dollars, and declaring all such marriages absolutely null and void, and the same law was again reenacted in its revised code of 1844. So that, down to the last-mentioned period, the strongest mark of inferiority and degradation was fastened upon the African race in that State.

 It is after his list of such restrictive and discriminatory laws that Justice Taney extrapolates that if it was the will of the states to exclude the black population from the status of citizenship within each of their respective dominions, then it is only appropriate that the same demographic be excluded from citizenship by the national government into which the respective states had vested their collective interests.  As Taney states,

&gt;For if they were so received, and entitled to the privileges and immunities of citizens, it would exempt them from the operation of the special laws and from the police regulations which they considered to be necessary for their own safety.

 And then it is here where Taney states the excerpt which pro-gun advocates so often emphasize:

&gt;It would give to persons of the negro race, who were recognised as citizens in any one State of the Union, the right to enter every other State whenever they pleased, singly or in companies, without pass or passport, and without obstruction, to sojourn there as long as they pleased, to go where they pleased at every hour of the day or night without molestation, unless they committed some violation of law for which a white man would be punished; and it would give them the full liberty of speech in public and in private upon all subjects upon which its own citizens might speak; to hold public meetings upon political affairs, *and to keep and carry arms wherever they went*.

Upon looking at the larger context of this excerpt, it would seem that the excerpt doesn’t actually mean what the pro-gun advocates interpret it to mean.  First of all, it would seem that some of the items within this excerpt correlate with the prohibitive laws previously mentioned.  The first is when he mentions “the right to enter every other State whenever they pleased . . . without pass or passport . . . .”  This correlates with the aforementioned 1774 Connecticut provision that required people of color to carry a pass when wandering outside the town of their residence.  And the second correlated item is -- in my interpretation -- the infamous line “and to keep and carry arms wherever they went”.   I understand this line to be an allusion to the 1815 New Hampshire law which limited the right of militia duty to only free white citizens of the state.   

Gun-rights advocates would likely interpret the latter line to refer to the text of the second amendment, and to refer to an individual right to own and carry guns for private purposes, such as self defense or sport.  However, it makes no sense for the line “to keep and carry arms wherever they went” to refer to the text of the second amendment.  Even though this line may sound similar to the line “the right of the people to keep and bear arms”, they are not the same, and the differences between the two are not at all negligible.  First of all, the second amendment refers to the right to “bear arms”, while the line from *Dred Scott* says “carry arms”.  The modern reader may simply see these two phrases as synonymous, but they are not.  The meaning of “carry arms” is straightforward, consisting of a transitive verb acting upon a noun; but the phrase “bear arms” does not actually refer to the carrying of arms, but rather is itself a phrasal verb and an idiomatic expression.  According to the Oxford English Dictionary -- the most authoritative resource on the English language -- the expression “bear arms” originated around AD 1325, and is correlated with the Latin phrase *arma ferre*, likely being simply a direct translation of the Latin.  Also according to the Oxford English Dictionary, the phrase is defined simply as “To serve as a soldier; to fight (for a country, cause, etc.).”  The sense of the phrase ""the right to bear arms"" in the sense that pro-gun advocates typically use the phrase is, according to the Oxford dictionary, an originally and chiefly American re-definition of the phrase, originating circa 1776.  Hence, the second amendment references the right of the people to keep arms and *to fight* and/or *serve as a soldier*; while the *Dred Scott* line instead references the right to keep arms and carry arms.  

Furthermore, the *Dred Scott* line also differs from the second amendment by including the modifier “wherever they went”.  No such modifier exists in the second amendment.  In fact, the second amendment is merely a prohibitive provision, one which is applied against Congress itself, and does not directly apply any affirmative granting of rights to the people.  It makes no sense to interpret an absolute prohibition against Congress as somehow establishing a modified affirming of rights to the people.  Because of these linguistic and textual details, it is, at best, quite a stretch to claim that the phrase “and to keep and carry arms wherever they went” is somehow a meaningful reference to the second amendment.

Some might alternatively argue that the line, rather than referring to the text of the second amendment specifically, is instead referring to the liberty of private gun use in general.  But what makes much more sense is that the line “and to keep and carry arms wherever they went”, instead of referring to private gun use, actually refers to militia duty.  It was customary in early America for militiamen to possess arms -- such as muskets or rifles -- in their personal custody (i.e. “to keep arms”), and to literally carry them wherever they went.  We can see evidence of this from numerous militia-related laws from early America from colonial times until the 20th century.  On example is a New York law from 1640:

&gt;ORDINANCE

&gt;Of the Director and Council of New Netherland, providing for the Arming and mustering of the Militia in case of danger. Passed 9 May, 1640.

&gt;\[N.Y. Col. MSS. IV. 61.\]

&gt;The Honble Director and Council have considered it advisable to ordain that the Inhabitants residing at and around Fort Amsterdam, of what state, quality or condition soever they be, *shall each provide himself with a good gun and keep the same in good repair and at all times ready and in order*; and as they live at a distance the one from the other, every warned person is placed under his Corporal in order that in time of danger he may appear at his post with his gun. Should it happen, which God forbid, that any mischief occur either from enemies or traitors at night, the people will be notified by the discharge of three cannon fired in quick succession; and if by day, means will be found to give warning to every one, who is commanded thereupon to repair instantly to his Corporal at the place appointed and then to adopt such measures as the exigency of the case shall require, on pain of being fined Fifty guilders. \[[link](https://firearmslaw.duke.edu/laws/1640-n-y-laws-23-ordinance-of-the-director-and-council-of-new-netherland-providing-for-the-arming-and-mustering-of-the-militia-in-case-of-danger)\]

 A Delaware law from 1782:

So it would seem that with a deeper understanding of the workings of the militia during early American history, the modifier “wherever they went” should more sensibly be correlated with the common practices surrounding compulsory militia service, rather than being correlated with any sort of voluntary liberty of carrying arms for private purposes.  

The connection that the pro-gun community makes between *Dred Scott* and the second amendment is tenuous at best.  Within the passage in bold from *Dred Scott*, there are four stated civil rights: the right to travel freely without a pass, the right to freedom of speech, the right to hold public meetings on political issues, and the right to keep and carry arms.  Of these four rights, only one of them can be said to correlate directly to the Bill of Rights: the right of freedom of speech.  The rest have no connection to the Bill of Rights.  And to assume that the phrase “to keep and carry arms” is directly related to the second amendment is a stretch, since the language between the two statements has only a superficial correlation.  These stated civil rights in bold do not represent the contents of the Bill of Rights, and thus cannot be interpreted as a general reference to that document; and the phrase “to keep and carry arms wherever they went” does not represent the second amendment directly; for these reasons, there is simply no argument that this passage from *Dred Scott* supports second amendment rights.   

Of the four stated civil rights, it would appear that Justice Taney mentions two of them as allusions to previously mentioned statutes: the line “and to keep and carry arms wherever they went” correlates to the aforementioned 1815 New Hampshire militia law which excluded black people from militia service; and an even more obvious connection is made between the line “the right to enter every other State whenever they pleased . . . without pass or passport” and the 1774 Connecticut law requiring black people to carry a pass while traveling.  

The other two stated civil rights -- freedom of speech and the right to hold public meetings -- appear to be outliers of this pattern, as they appear to have been mentioned without any aforementioned precedent in state law.  However, there might still be a particular reason why Justice Taney saw fit to mention these particular rights.  It so happens that most of the items listed in the bolded excerpt are also stipulated in the Declaration of Rights in the 1820 Missouri State Constitution.  This is especially relevant since the *Dred Scott* case centered on whether the plaintiff was still considered a slave in the slave state of Missouri after having gained his freedom after traveling to the free state of Illinois.  Notably, the two outlier items are also addressed in the Missouri Constitution.

The statement from *Dred Scott* which says “and it would give them the full liberty of speech in public and in private upon all subjects upon which its own citizens might speak” appears to correlate with Article 13, Clause 16:

&gt;That the free communication of thoughts and opinions is one of the invaluable rights of man, and that every person may freely speak, write, and print, on any subject, being responsible for the abuse of that liberty.

 And the statement “to hold public meetings upon political affairs” appears to correlate with Article 13, Clause 2:

&gt;That the people of this state have the inherent, sole, and exclusive right of regulating the internal government and police thereof, and of altering and abolishing their constitution and form of government, whenever it may be necessary to their safety and happiness.

Furthermore, in addition to their connection to the discriminatory laws already established within the text of *Dred Scott*, the remaining two items from the excerpt also appear to have correlates in the Missouri Constitution as well.  The statement about the right of a citizen “to enter every other State whenever they pleased” appears to correlate with a clause in Article 3, section 26:

&gt;It shall be their \[the general assembly’s\] duty, as soon as may be, to pass such laws as may be necessary--1. To prevent free negroes and mulattoes from coming to and settling in this State, under any pretext whatsoever;

 And it also seems to correlate with Article 13, Clause 21:

&gt; That migration from this state cannot be prohibited.

And the statement “and to keep and carry arms wherever they went” appears to correlate with the state arms provision in part of Article 13, Clause 3:

&gt;that their right to bear arms, in defense of themselves and of the state, cannot be questioned.

Compared to the second amendment, this arms provision in the Missouri Constitution seems more pertinent to the arms statement mentioned in the *Dred Scott* decision, since this provision specifically qualifies the lawful purposes for which the right to bear arms may be exercised, which the second amendment does not do.

**Conclusion**

Some might say that it only makes sense that Justice Taney is referring to the federal Bill of Rights in the bolded excerpt because he is speaking on behalf of the United States Supreme Court, which is a federal body.  However, this interpretation is uninformed.  When we look at the actual context of the *Dred Scott* decision, it is clear that the particular point that Justice Taney is making in that excerpt pertains much more to state law than to federal law.  Even though the decision that Justice Taney is making is a federal decision, he is clearly making this federal decision based on state premises.

It has never been the primary prerogative of the federal government to grant rights to American citizens.  It is state governments that have the primary authority and function of specifying and granting civil rights.  Hence, Justice Taney wasn't saying that making black people into citizens -- at the federal level -- would give them rights; his point was that federally making black people into citizens would effectively negate the prohibitive laws that the states have established in order to subjugate their black populations.  In other words, making black people into citizens would create a kind of ""double negative"" whose effect is a positive: it would not actually give them anything, but instead would *take away* the laws that *take away* their liberties.  The verbiage ""it would *give* to persons of the negro race..."" is hence metaphorical rather than literal.  It's like if a judge were to exonerate a convicted prison inmate through DNA evidence: the judge isn't actually *giving* the inmate his freedom; the judge is just *removing* his incarceration.  Thus, it is merely the result of a quirk of language and rhetoric that Justice Taney *appears* to be affirming that American citizens are entitled to the liberty to keep and carry arms wherever they go.  But for gun advocates to take this rhetoric literally, as they often do, is simply a wrong conclusion to draw

As for the content of the bolded excerpt, I can’t say how purposeful or how arbitrary this particular assortment of rights was meant to be.  At least two of the four items appear to be references to state laws which he had previously referenced, yet he breaks this pattern with the other two items, which do not have any statutory precursor in *Dred Scott*; and there are even more state laws referenced earlier that he *does not* allude to in the bolded list.  And furthermore, all of the items in the list could be said to have correlates in the 1820 Missouri Constitution; but it is not clear whether Justice Taney was actually alluding to that constitution in particular -- because of its relevance to the case at hand, or if he was referencing any other state constitution.  In summary, I don’t know exactly why Justice Taney chose the particular list of items that he chose in the bolded excerpt of his majority opinion in *Dred Scott*; however, I can say with much more confidence what this excerpt *does not* indicate.  He is not referencing the federal Bill of Rights as a whole; he is not referencing the second amendment in particular; and he is likely not referencing the general liberty of private firearm rights.  Therefore, there is no basis for pro-gun advocates to use this case as a means to argue for firearm rights.

manoteee,It is time to sell your Tesla and divest of Elon Musk companies for real now.,"I know 20+ liberals who own Teslas or Starlink, with a few Powerwalls in Phoenix, etc. etc. If you’re a liberal and own a Tesla or any Elon Musk product, it’s time to sell it—and any shares you hold in Elon Musk companies—to someone whose political ideology is more aligned with his.

When you meet the buyer to complete the transaction, I suggest adopting the emerging conservative salute: raise your hand to your chest and then extend it outward at a 45-degree angle, aggressively yet straight. This reassures the potentially autistic buyer that you are familiar with the long-established and frequently cited (at least in America) norms and salutations of the Roman Republic.

Joking aside, Elon causes harm to marginalized and vulnerable communities and remains unapologetic when it’s brought to his attention. He has the capacity to do significantly more harm if he chooses—and it seems he does. This divestment isn’t about “sending a message” though it may; it’s about finding peace of mind. Should significant harm befall his perceived enemies, at least you can say you had no part in it.

Even some very liberal people are tired of hearing the Nazi comparisons. I strongly agree, and when these men stop acting like Nazis, we can stop making the comparisons.  
  
Fascism is a virus that exploits a decent person’s good nature and desire for patience and understanding. It twists your desire for normalcy into a weapon and turns it back on you. If you do not speak out or act against it, you are complicit in it. It cannot be voted away (if that’s not already obvious). Patience and “understanding” are its fuel. The Nazi does not speak in your language; its only form of communication is fear and violence. You cannot “wait it out,” as no amount of blood can satiate it. It isn’t tied to a single person or party—though it often prefers the right—it will inhabit whatever host isn’t actively fighting it. It is, in effect, a living, breathing villain with unlimited time and resources at its disposal—like Satan.  
  
Four hundred thousand American grandfathers, great-grandfathers, and others gave their lives fighting fascism, with many millions more gravely injured or scarred by trauma. Many of us have seen the legacy of this damage firsthand. The absurdity of a man now making the hand gesture meant to praise Hitler and swear loyalty to him spits on that sacrifice. In fact, “spits on” is an understatement; it’s the biggest “fuck you” I can imagine being made to a veteran of that era.

_invest_,Things you can do right now.,"Volunteer. It will help you meet other people who volunteer, and remind you that there are still kind people left on earth.

Invite friends to a board games night. Cultivate a community of people you like, and try to spend as much time as you can with those people. That way your idle hours will be filled more with memories of those people, and less with arguments you've had with strangers on the internet.

Set up recurring donations to local organisations. Invest locally. If we all invest locally, we'll gradually build a large network of small communities that are closer knit. Donate money to your local homeless shelter or domestic violence shelter. Buy from a local business. Buy art from a local artist.

Take up a new hobby. Get off the internet. Things will always seem worse online than they really are. Find something engrossing you can do away from the computer. A new hobby is also a great way to make new friends and cultivate a community.

Send a physical letter to someone.

""Like"" a post on LinkedIn by someone you like but haven't spoken to in a while.

Volunteer with a local climate change organization. Climate change can happen at a local level as well. Go to their next meetup and figure out what policies they are pushing for locally, and help push for them. They probably organize trash pickup days. Go to the next one.

When (predictably) asked if they will target Cartel in Mexico, Trump said ""Maybe"" and that ""stranger things have happened"" along with a promise ""to use the full and immense power of federal and state law enforcement to eliminate the presence of all foreign gang criminal networks.""  When asked how México may feel about it, Trump said to ask them how they feel (I am anxiously awaiting Sheinbaum's response).

I personally have been keeping up with Sheinbaum as a president, and she is very serious. She is Mexico's 2nd leftist president in decades, the first being her predecesor Obrador (AMLO). The interesting thing is that Obrador cleaned up a ton of government corruption and illegal activity, embezzlement etc. The Cartel is still active (in some areas more than others) but it's not close to how bad it was 30+ years ago. Sheinbaum is more leftist than he is and is furthering what he started. But make no mistake she is very no-nonsense and has clearly been preparing for whatever the U.S. may try once Trump took office. They have been moving Mexico to be less dependent on the U.S. by increasing domestic productions and trading with europe

So, *when* the U.S. inevitably kills Mexican citizens in Mexico because the U.S. has designated them terrorists, what happens next? Mexico very well could consider it an act of terrorism themselves, or just an act of outright war.

To a future where other countries will fear us because we will take what we want because ""Macht ist Recht"", and where they no longer respect us or look up to us for our democratic institutions and ideals and commitment to them. 

Dark times are ahead and we must resist them lest society's privileges are enjoyed only by card carrying MAGATs, and the words ""USA"" become scorned and despised like ""Nazi"" by future generations around the world. We who do so are true to the vision of America's Founding Fathers, not those loud-mouthed, gun brandishing, flag waving self proclaimed patriots of the right who want their freedoms at the expense of others. 

Keep the faith and continue to vote against the dark side (hopefully that is never taken away).  Educate your children, family and friends to know what American democracy is and do all they can to maintain it.

I was never open borders, but I used to be a bit of the ""people can't be illegal"" type. 

As I have seen more of the reality of barely checked immigration on local governments and economies (i.e. companies paying lower wages to illegals), i have shifted positions some. 

I want more legal immigration and better border processes, and I think illegal immigration is a bad hill to die on for the left.

Same can be said about states like TX. Some of the blue states seem to have more people leaving than there are people moving to them. 

Will this election change that? We know that the quality of life in red and blue states is vastly different. It can even be argued that it can be seen on the county level. Blue states have more social programs, more consumer protections, workers' rights, and other things that can really aid people should they hit hard times as well as protect them from some of those hard times from occurring in the first place. Red states, by large, don't have these things or they are rendered useless because they are so limited or not enforced properly.

We also know a Republican controlled Congress (no matter how slim) and Trump's presidency will undoubtedly make things much harder for a lot of people no matter what state you live in. When this comes, will people rely more on those protections and programs that blue states have? Will they decide that it is worth moving out of red states in favor of blue states since there isn't a federal government that will protect them?

Ive noticed his content tends to gaslight people into thinking we are overreacting when we say stuff like homophobia, misogyny and racism are still current issues and some right wing voters immediately shut that idea down because of the equal rights everyone in America has. They seem to believe the homophobia/racism is just petty discourse online and isn't really as big of an issue as we make it out to be because we aren't  in the 1900s anymore and everyone is ""equal""

I want to refer to something I learnt in History class called the five stages of isolation, which is basically a progression of actions leading to mass genocide by Hitler and many other cruel dictators from the past. The first stage was bias attitude, second was act of bias, third was systemic discrimination, fourth was bias motivated violence and fifth was obviously genocide. 

To the conservatives the discrimination minorities face might just be nothing in today's day and age, but it can quickly progress to mass genocide just like it did in Germany, Japan e.t.c 

Like it's already at level 4 and thats why minorities are so scared man, like I dont understand why ppl just love to disregard people's experiences and say they r overreacting.

thepeoplessgt,The Conservatives are using the L.A. fires to begin the attempt to make a Republican Governor of California. (Rant),"Gavin Newsom will be termed out in 2026. The Conservatives kept mentioning him as a possible replacement for Joe Biden in the 2024 election. I suspect they are expecting him to run in 2028 and are already gearing up a smear campaign to knock him out of the primaries. 

Right now they are blaming the fires on Democrat leadership. My guess is that the Conservatives, who now basically run the GOP will find a conservative candidate to run for Governor in 2026. This candidate will no doubt be endorsed by Trump. 

Once Trump officially takes office, I expect Comer and Jordan to launch the first investigation of the year against Newsom and the Mayor of L.A (a Black female Democrat). It will be a show trial that doesn’t solve anything. The main purpose is to make the people of California think the Democrats are idiots. If it works is a different story. 

What I find funny is how hypocritical the conservatives are. During the election they hated the “Hollywood elites”. Now they sympathize with them for losing the their million dollar homes.

TaylorHu,Are you all quitting Meta?,"I'm sure this has already been discussed and I missed it, so hard to keep up with everything.

But, what do you all think? Should we all quit Meta? I mean, I've been wanting to reduce my time spent on social media for a while now and all that anyway. And these latest decisions could absolutely be justification I finally needed. I certainly don't like the idea that me eyeballs are generating any revenue for Zuckerberg. I already dropped Twitter for Bluesky a while ago. So, one way of looking it is we should take the high road and just #exitmeta. And when this news first broke that was my first instinct. I posted statuses saying I was leaving and that everyone could find me on Bluesky, deleted the apps off my phone, did all that.

But another way to look at it is that that's letting them win. There's been a lot of talk about how one of the big reasons that Republicans keep winning elections is that they're winning the information war. Somehow, despite us supposedly being the party of young, smart and tech savvy people, they've beat us at the online (mis)information game. We can have a totally completely different discussion on why that is, what we could have done differently but it's true. So maybe we shouldn't quit Meta. Maybe now it's up to us to double down and fight there. To all dedicate some time to add these ""community notes"" that they're going to use instead. To make sure that actual real news gets liked and shared as much as possible. Plus, a lot of my local activist organizations still use IG as their primary way of organizing. Maybe some will move to Bluesky or something else, but so far I haven't seen a huge exit by them or anything.


UPDATE: A majority of these replies have either been ""I never joined,"" or ""I quit years ago."" Which kind of speaks to my biggest concern. If none of us are on social media to combat misinformation then more people, young people, fresh voters, will be exposed to it and radicalized. I was really shocked about how much Trump improved with young and first time voters. But once you realize they get most of their information from Instagram and TikTok, and we've all abandoned those platforms with our typical scoldy, judgemental attitude towards them and people that still use them, what did we think was going to happen?

And that’s that women are allowed to shame men and look and them as predators but that same thing is looked down upon highly if you do that to a black person. 

For example, It’s considered ok as a woman to be fearful and ignore a man in public if he comes up to ask for the time or directions. But if this same action was done because somebody was black it would be considered racist. 

If a woman directs anger at men for harnessing “rape culture”, it’s considered ok. But if somebody said that black people harness gangster culture, it would be considered racist. 

-If a woman hates men in general because of being assaulted by one, it’s considered ok by society. But if somebody hates black people because they were assaulted by a black person, it’s considered racist.

Icy_Statement_2410,The U.S. Judicial System Has Failed,"The purpose of the Judicial System was to ensure that no person is above the law, and that the court and/or judges are not prejudicial towards anybody simply based on elected office. The ending of Trump's first election interference case has officially proved that notion false. No president had ever tested the limits of presidential immunity like this, and it is now proven that a president is given leniencies for their crimes, putting a potential 4 year sentencing to zero. Not a fine, not community service, ZERO. The fact that a sentencing even took place today was a surprise to just about everybody, especially since it was revealed that SC Justice Alito had a personal phone call with Trump the *day before* Trump requested a delay in sentencing with the supreme court.

 What Trump has been allowed to get away with just since he has left office has completely broken the judicial system. He was allowed to use stall tactics with no merits, again and again and again while the judges just kept going along with it. Held in contempt 10 times for violating gag orders, posting about the judge, their family, the jury, etc. As the prosecutor put it, Trump was ""relentless"" in his attacks on the cases, all parties involved, and even the rule of law itself. He has done irreparable damage to how the law is viewed and how it is applied. And he was able to do all of this while *not* being president, meaning as an ex-president he was given extreme leniencies that allowed him to go 6+ months after conviction to sentencing. This is (as far as I know) unprecedented even in New York City. 

On the bigger scale, Trump was convicted of election interference, creating a plan to prevent information from being released that would impact the electio, and falsifying business records to hide it. All the evidence is overwhelming and decisive. What to speak of all of the evidence in his multiple other criminal cases. And now he is President-Elect, and we all have to pretend none of that exists anymore because he won a popularity contest. 

Throughout all of the court proceedings for the criminal activities of Trump, he has always argued presidential immunity, even if it is clearly not in the ""official"" scope of presidential immunity. So, clearly there is an ""unofficial"" scope of presidential immunity that might just be up to the discretion of the judge? But then of course, that leads us to the highest court in the land, an un-elected board of appointed judges that for the long foreseeable future have been shaped by the felon convicted of election interference and still currently on trial for more election interference across multiple jurisdictions.

ComfortableWage,What are you guys doing to stay positive/respond to the disaster we're about to witness enter the presidency?,"We are witnessing a rise in hatred and intolerance in America that Trump originally let out of the closet when he first took office in 2016. Now that he's back we have corporations like Meta saying that if someone is LGBTQ+ it's okay to insult them for having mental illnesses, but you can't do it towards conservatives. It's insane.

Not going to lie, I'm scared for the future of this country. I'm scared for women and the LGBTQ+ community. I'm scared for the working and middle class, both of which are in Trump's crosshairs. I'm scared for immigrants. I don't like the fact I can draw so many parallels between Trump and Hitler. I don't like any of it.

In spite of all that, I keep trying to be positive which admittedly, is hard as hell.

Potential_One1,Would you support The Wyoming Rule?,"As of 2024, if you live in Wyoming, your vote carries about 3.7 times more weight in the presidential election than if you live in California. This disparity arises because each electoral vote (EV) in Wyoming represents approximately 194,690 people, while each EV in California represents about 721,670 people.

I still think that the national popular vote should be determining the presidency, regardless of which party benefits. The common argument against this—that cities like New York or Los Angeles would dominate elections—doesn’t really hold much weight in reality. Only about 32.9% of the U.S. voting-age population resides in the ten largest metro areas. Even if every single person in these metro areas voted the same way (which they don’t and wouldn’t), the remaining 67.1% of the electorate still holds substantial influence.

While the Electoral College is unlikely to be abolished, I think it should be adjusted to better reflect where people actually live. One potential solution is the ""Wyoming Rule,"" which proposes increasing the size of the U.S. House of Representatives so that the representative-to-population ratio aligns with the smallest state—currently Wyoming. This adjustment would redistribute electoral votes more fairly:

California - 71 EV (+33%)

Texas - 53 EV (+34%)

Florida - 39 EV (+32%)

...

Rhode Island - 4 EV (+0%)

Vermont - 3 EV (+0%)

Wyoming - 3 EV (+0%)

**Total : 538 \~&gt; 677 (+32%)**

Would you support a reform like this? It doesn’t inherently benefit one party over another; it simply makes votes more equal across states.

In fact, using the 2024 presidential election, under this new system:

Harris has **283** easily locked EV's.

Trump has **275** easily locked EV's.

Swing states hold **119** EV's.",63,0.88,34,1736274180,Liberal

NoLingonberry4261,"Putin, Trump, Musk – Who’s the Biggest Threat to the World? Let’s Rank Them","Here’s my take on who poses the greatest threat to the world and why:

3️⃣ Trump – The Easily Manipulated Narcissist

	•	A narcissistic idiot, but the key difference is that he’s not strategic—he just reacts.

	•	Easily influenced by whoever flatters him the most at any given moment.

	•	No real ideology—just self-interest, which makes him unpredictable but also limits his effectiveness.

	•	The danger comes from his enablers (think Bannon, MAGA extremists, and billionaire backers) who use him as a tool.

	•	Would absolutely hand over Ukraine to Putin when he got back in office, just to feel like a “deal maker.”

⚠️ Threat level: High, but mostly because of the people around him.

2️⃣ Musk – The Tech Billionaire With Too Much 
Power 

	•	Another narcissistic idiot, but unlike Trump, he actually controls powerful global infrastructure (Starlink, AI, Twitter/X).

	•	Shifts opinions constantly—one day he’s pro-Ukraine, the next he’s practically reciting Kremlin talking points.

	•	Not ideological, just ego-driven—he craves being worshiped and will adapt his views to whatever makes him feel important.

	•	Biggest danger? He owns tools that shape wars, elections yet he’s reckless and impulsive.

🚨 Threat level: Higher than Trump because he has more real-world power and even less accountability.

1️⃣ Putin – The Calculated Threat

	•	Unlike Trump and Musk, Putin is not an idiot—he’s a high-functioning narcissist with a long-term strategy.

	•	He knows exactly what he’s doing and plays the long game with brutality and precision.

	•	Has directly started wars, committed war crimes, and openly threatens nuclear conflict.

	•	Not just a danger to democracy, but to global stability. His entire goal is to destabilize the West so Russia can gain more power.

	•	The most dangerous because he is willing to kill and destroy on a mass scale, and he’s good at it.

☠️ Threat level: #1 by far. Unlike the other two, he has an actual plan, and it’s terrifying.

Final Ranking of Danger

🥇 1. Putin – Ruthless, intelligent, and willing to burn the world down.

🥈 2. Musk – Reckless, unstable, and dangerously influential.

🥉 3. Trump – Dumb, easily manipulated, and dangerous mostly because of his enablers.

Round_Skill8057,"Questions about symbols, freedom of speech, nationalism","Apologies in advance for the rant. 
For as long as I can remember I've been a big fan of the fact that the the US enshrined free speech in the constitution.  One of the few things I still find to be proud of here, we still mostly let people express themselves how they want.  As such I've also been very wary of people who want to use the power of the government or even social pressure to punish speech and certain kinds of expression that make them feel icky or doesn't agree with whatever they've had on a loop in their heads for the last 60 years.  I find fewer examples of those people scarier than the flag fanatics.  Nationalism has been alive and well in the US for a long time, but it just keeps growing like some kind of swollen, idiocy cancer.  It's frightening because it seems so pervasive, so obviously the opposite of the freedom of the individual that is central to the American ideal, and yet so many of our own citizens are so poorly educated in civics, and basic logic and critical thinking that they don't see the conflict between individual freedom, and laws that regulate speech or even their own insistence that *my* type of expression is protected, but yours isn't.  All over the US, people have American flags on display, all year round, sometimes lots of them.  Flags are fine. They're symbolic communication. It's a symbol of something important to the person who hung it up.  But with the American flag then there are the rules that come with it.  There are a host of them.  All of these rules are fine too.  They are very much like the rules of a religion, or the rules of a certain design esthetic. They may seem arbitrary, nonsensical, or completely superfluous to the uninitiated, but they all serve functions, and, nevertheless, they exist, someone thought of them, wrote them down and others like them. Many people follow these rules.  That is also just fine.  It's when these people insist that everyone else must also follow their flag rules - that is, strict rules about the proper handling of special pieces of colored fabric, we're not talking about organ transplants or unexplored ordinance, here, just nicely decorated cloth - that they have crossed a line.  Why don't they see it?  Your religion says you must do these things and mustn't do those things.  By being a member of that religion, you are following the rules you set down for yourself.  You can't mandate those rules for others.  Are these flag nuts the same people who want to tell me what I can and can't do with my body?   Are they the same people who want public libraries and schools to ban certain books they don't like?  How can they be such proud devotees of ""America"" and completely oblivious to the Incompatability of personal freedom and restrictions on expression?  Some such ""proud Americans"" living near me have said that people who burn the flag in protest should be thrown in prison for life, be physically tortured, raped and killed.  Many agreed.  I suggested that seems like harsh treatment for someone who is destroying a piece of cloth that is not stolen property, and is identical to hundreds of millions of other pieces of cloth like it.  In fact I said it shouldn't be punished at all, and is actually a protected form of expression, ie free speech.  They called me a piece of shit.  Oh they railed at me.  These lunatics crawled out of the woodwork to type in all caps at me because clearly I'm the idiot. And I don't care about that.  Call me an idiot piece of shit, call me a cunt and a whore, call me a nazi or terrorist or whatever.  It's their right to call me whatever because they have the right to free speech.  I'm glad they can call me whatever they want without fear of being arrested for blasphemy or some other medieval bullshit.  But seriously, Who tf are these psychos?  Did no one else listen in 7th grade social studies?  Did none of them make the connection between pride and nationalism, and between censorship and fascism?  I'm so grossly disappointed in all of us.  If you told me when I was that 7th grader (long long time ago now) that our country was this full of morons I wouldn't have believed you.  I think the country's average IQ now has dropped into hypothermic territory, and scarier still is I don't have much hope that we'll ever be able to fix it.  I can't see any path for us to move forward with a populace that is this dumb-as-fuck.  It's not fun to be an average cow in a herd stampedeing toward a cliff, realizing that we're all going to plummet to our deaths if we don't change course, and screaming at the rest of the cattle to turn but your herd mates are all too fucking stupid to listen.

I'm sure over the course of the next four years we'll get posts from people who lament their choices this election. I won't have any sympathy. In fact, I'll gladly give them the middle finger. 

The writing has been on the walls for months... years even. Harris, to anyone with common sense, was the better candidate. Regardless of the culture war nonsense she was young, had more experience, and smarter than Trump or Biden. She garnered MILLIONS MORE votes than Hillary did against Trump and STILL lost. It's insane.

So when people inevitably regret their decisions I'm not going to hold back the punches. All the warnings were handed to them on a silver platter and they ignored them. They were brainwashed by Fox News and other alt-right influencers like Joe Rogan. And while them regretting their decision might be considered a good thing, it won't change my response.

Hard to even describe the sadness I’ve been feeling about being the only one in my entire family that is liberal /democrat .. and god I miss the days of being ignorant to it all and not even knowing where they stand and what it meant . And I have been at a battle with myself about being in there life or not … I will be making a appointment soon and hopefully starting therapy soon but yeah it’s hard and I could really use some guidance from those older and wiser or with similar circumstances and how you have chosen to move forward .. I’m naturally a very irritable, emotional person and its always been extremely hard to let go of grudges .. tbh so every ounce of me just wants to cut them off and never talk t them again . but the other small part of me is like are you fuckin sure about that ? Like my entire family ? My big huge family ? never ever going to another Christmas or thanksgiving or gathering like that’s a really big commitment . to never have family again , there are maybe a select few I would stick around for like my little sis or grandmas but for the most part I just feel hatred for most of them so I guess my biggest dilemma is how can I keep these people in my life ..look at them and smile and make small talk when I have all this anger and sadness built up towards them … and before anyone says to just talk to them I’d have to let you know I can not do that atleast not until after a million therapy sessions and maybe some anxiety meds because confrontation is my biggest fear so I’m a very long ways away from doing that route 🥶

book-3,Cheesy romance novel,"Let me start by saying that this may not belong here, and that I am primarily asking for guidance as to which subreddit might be better suited for this content.

So, I am writing a cheesy romance novel targeted at 25-45 year old conservative women. It is going to be full of nonsense people here would find appalling. The intent is to really make fun of people who would agree with the story line.

As AI puts it, this will be a romance novel with emotionally satisfying storytelling that aligns with traditional values - featuring strong family themes, faith elements, and relationships that develop within moral boundaries. I am throwing in xenophobia, sexism and anti-LGBTQ elements to reflect the nonsense these people seem to believe in.

As a side note, this will be significantly aided by AI. Also, I am writing this as a test run before I write something more substantial and something I actually believe in.

All that said, if I were to share my progress as I go through the process of creating this piece of nonsense, what subreddit would be better suited for it?",1,1,0,1734810855,Liberal

mounteverest04,Is the problem that the Democratic Party isn't democratic enough?,"I've been thinking. The mission of the Democratic Party from now on should be to break down the 2-party monopoly- *duopoly*? I don't know... Anyway, leadership should fight for ranked choice voting at all levels of government. 

They should also fight to get rid of: The filibuster, and the Electoral College (Along with gerrymandering). Fight that Supreme Court Judges get elected through other means other than a sheer presidential selection. I mean - the US is ranked 30-36 in the world democracy index and is deemed a ""Deficient democracy"".   
  
I'm sure they don't want to bite their own tail. But the TRUTH is - You can't be a Democratic Party in a non-Democratic system. I mean, 2 freaking parties in a country of 350 + million people is a complete joke. 

Now, a true democratic system is going to be harder to implement because the 2-party paradigm is well baked into the American psyche. But it's absolutely necessary. MAGA should have been its own extreme/fringe movement. But because it has to be 2 and only 2 competing parties, it has swallowed up the Republican Party. And now, the political Overton window has stretched out way further, and they have so much more power than if MAGA were just a third party - and we are all paying for it.

Psythusforreal,A horrifying reality of Trump's 2nd term. NO ONE is safe from p2025. Am I the only one seeing this?,"Can we start to assume that no one this time in the white house will ever be liable for anything anymore so long as their lips are aligned with Trump's asshole and suck whatever comes out?

No one on his Legion of Doom will ever have consequences for their actions until they devour themselves for power over whatever is left standing when they are done using anyone that goes against them for slave labor.

I've been calling this game MAGAtes and p2025 have laid out for years.. but I need to run it by other liberals that can be objective and tell me I'm not right. I hope I'm not.

If you can follow this logic and have any decent memory of events in the past 3 Republican terms, you might feel like this is an actually real scenario... If I'm way off on something please call me out. I'm not saying this will be exact, but that the end result will be the same regardless of the how's and when's.

We won't have mass deportation like he's saying but there will be laws that ramp up justice arm's power to get rid of and imprison people here slowly over time .. which eventually through p2025 can fall on ANYONE they decide they wish to detain or get rid of.. even US born citizens. They will have the power to decide unilaterally and disregard civil rights and due process.

It will start with the undocumented immigrants they locate.. then find people who are expendable or have criminal records, people with addictions or that have had govt assistance, down to people that just aren't ""American"" enough, dangers or non-patriots.. they will be rounded up to be ""reformed."" They'll use camps for these people and work their way down the list until you have his side, and those suffering doing Chinese/gulag/gestapo-style govt labor to achieve forever power and control over us. You can change the terms and methods but let's assume they can do what they want, because they have everything they need now to do so.

Think it's crazy? Conspiracy? Yeah I get it but sometimes we see things before they happen and never listen to the ones who warned us. But it's all in the 2025 playbook and we've been here before. This time only the people can stop it, but that won't happen when we're scared and shut in our homes asking for help, saying yeah but not MY family right?

All they need to do is what I've been saying for years, declare another seemingly needed, but ultimately bullshit ""war.."" 

I think this time it will be the ""war on immigration"" or something so they can make up emergency war time acts/laws.. just like the war on terror. Which was how we got the patriot act..  remember that? Civil liberties trampled on, privacy violated. We were scared, so they were allowed to quell our fears, but what they were really doing was not targeted at terror and our enemies, but at Americans themselves. 

People are scared again, and just like COVID you get rich by causing a problem and selling the solution. This time I truly feel like they're going to take everything from us.. and what I fear more is that they know we can't sustain our population anymore, and they intend to close ranks, save themselves, and watch the rest of us slowly fade into genocidal memory.

ellieminnow," Democrats that said they don't vote because they live in an area that's always red, and their vote doesn't matter. ","**About 86 million eligible voters didn’t vote in the last election.**

If you're one of them that didn’t vote because you feel like your voice doesn’t matter, I’m not here to blame or attack you. It’s easy to feel powerless in a system that often feels stacked against us. My point is simple: you matter more than you might think. Even if your candidate doesn’t win, when you show up, others in your community will see they’re not alone. Maybe your vote could inspire them to show up next time.

Let’s take a closer look at why every vote matters, even in areas perceived as overwhelmingly red.

# Example 1: [Glascock County, Georgia](https://results.sos.ga.gov/results/public/glascock-county-ga/elections/2024NovGen)

* **Registered voters:** 2,073
* **Turnout:** 81% (1,682 ballots cast)
* **Didn’t vote:** 391
   * **Trump:** 1,534 (91.86%)
   * **Kamala Harris:** 133 (7.96%)

Even if all 391 non-voters had shown up and voted for Kamala, giving her **524 votes**, Trump still would have won. In counties like these, it’s easy to feel like voting is futile.

# Example 2: [Baker County, Georgia](https://results.sos.ga.gov/results/public/baker-county-ga/elections/2024NovGen)

* **Registered voters:** 2,066
* **Turnout:** 72% (1,486 ballots cast)
* **Didn’t vote:** 580
   * **Trump:** 883 (59.82%)
   * **Kamala Harris:** 590 (39.97%)

If just **444 of the 580 non-voters** had shown up and voted for Kamala, she would have won. It’s not impossible to imagine enough of those remaining voters choosing Kamala to secure the win.

Even if your candidate doesn’t win, increasing turnout changes perceptions. For example, in Glascock County, **1534 vs. 524** sends a stronger message than **1534 vs. 133.** It shows Democrats have local support, making progressive voices less isolated. This visibility can energize communities, spark deeper discussions, and even sway centrists or independents in future elections.

It’s not lost on me that counties are part of larger congressional districts, where votes across multiple counties determine outcomes for House seats and electoral votes. For example, there’s an entire section of Georgia that voted blue in the last election but turned red in this one. If just one county in that area turns blue again, it could create a ripple effect, shifting the district’s votes back to blue in future elections.

Every vote contributes to a bigger picture—it’s not just about winning today, but about shaping tomorrow’s outcomes.

The one thing I want you to take from this: You matter.

lostinsauceyboi,Why do we always have to pretend as though we win every time we start to lose?,"These past few years I can't stand watching liberal and left-wing news or news content creators. By no means have I come anywhere close to giving up or falling for right-wing conspiratorial to outright false talking points, but I can't stand it anymore. I watch MSNBC and the reactions are always the same. Either shock that Trump or his supporters said something, smugness over right wing hypocrisy and cognitive dissonance, or stern scolding to people who aren't watching. And then we act and treat this as a win when Trump supporters don't care. They never will because they already believe that every negative thing about him is fake, if he does do anything he said he wouldn't do it's the right choice or a ploy, and that if what he said doesn't work-out he was misled or sabotage. We act like we haven't been dealing with these people for years. Trump and his supports will never accept a loss even as they are eating the rotten discarded remains.

Even when we do win it's not like they care anyways. I just saw a video about how Trump said the egg prices would go down before he even took office (because of course he is the darn tootenist gosh golly thing to touch the economy since overspeculation, buying on margin, and high variable interest rates) and while I care that eggs are still expensive, I stopped listening to Trumps boasting a long time ago. Trump supporters are still blaming Biden, and they'll continue blame him and other democrats as long as they possibly can. We act like people aren't treating us as villains for cutting out trump supporting family members and friends even though they'll pretend that their crowd has never done that. I can't be brought to care if you cut trump supporters out, by all means it might make your life better, but we act like it's only been a good thing for liberals and democrats. 

I talk to Trump supporters, both in my family and workplace. They haven't ""fallen besides themselves"" since Matt Gaetz withdrew, they see it as either an operation to remove democratic/rhino opposition to Trump's next appointee or as Gaetz willingly and nobly stepping to the side so that the ""Democrat psy-op"" and ""Forged accusations"" won't distract from Trump's next term. We know that handing them the receipts won't convince them because they will have forgotten to read. When they do happen to get a win, we default to talking about our wins that they don't care about, and it just comes across as though we're living in a fantasy land. It's like we're trying to emulate them but somehow missed the point of why they behave like they do.

How the hell are you going to pick a top 10 out of so many sports.  We can’t even decide on a top 10 in one position of a single sport but we are going to pick one for all sports?  Anyway, the list had people like Pele and Gretzky and Ali and of course LeBron James.  There is no way to unite conservative, white, males, quite like their hatred for LeBron James.  I know men who haven’t watched a game since Jordan was in his prime but every one of them hates LeBron.  “THIS ISN’T ABOUT HIS POLITICS!!!  HE IS OVERRATED AND RUINING THE GAME!”  Yes, it is about politics.  I know because you don’t watch basketball and don’t give a shit about the game but you have very strong feelings about a player that you have never watched play.  It’s like the Kaitlyn Clark/Angel Reese thing.  Want to rile up a white, conservative, woman?  Just tell them you think Reese is a good player.  You don’t even need to mention Clark.  Just complimenting Reese is enough.  My mother has went to hundreds of sporting events to watch her children and grandchildren play various sports.  She couldn’t tell you how the points work in any sport besides maybe Soccer.  She spent 35 years living with a die hard Bears fan and she asked me the other day if I thought the Cubs might make the Super Bowl this year.  But bring up Clark and it’s all “Oh I love her, she plays with class!”  What the fuck does that even mean?  She once told me that Reese only gets the points because she is rebounding her own missed shots.  This woman doesn’t even know what a rebound is.  The whole Bird/Magic thing was a little before my time, was it like this back then?   I say all this because this is why the fight is so hard.  Conservatives are united in their hatred.  United against the libtards and the gay agenda and the war on Christmas and against Wokeness.  Their hatred unites them like nothing units the Left.  On the Left we have different views.

However, the democrats of today is something I’m familiar with. I want to know what it meant to be a democrat say 60 years ago.

There were still Americans fighting for equal rights. There’s always charts showing how long women have had to wait to file for divorce, own a house, have their own bank account. Really basic shit that could never get taken away today.

What were democrats fighting for/against 60 years ago? 

As a tangent, I just want to remind everyone how far we’ve come. Nixon got 49 states and almost double the amount of votes than McGovern. America was pure red, and yes, the republican back then was different than today

But gay people can marry who they want, it’s been than way for almost 10 years. Trans people have more opportunity to be who they are than ever before. Women unfortunately suffered a huge loss in 2022, and still aren’t quite there yet in other ways. But have much more rights than women did 60 years ago.

That’s how far we’ve come. Trump and his little clique are most likely going to do some shit, shit that will undo years of work to equalize America. But like Ms. Harris said, we are not going back.

RenziumZ,What were republicans like before Trump? TLDR at the bottom,"I was 2 years old when W Bush was reelected in 2004, so I never paid much attention to politics obviously. Hell, I’m sure that even when I was 6 I probably didn’t know Obama was president for a long while. But I knew he was president as some point and obviously he’s amazing

But 2016 rolls around and Donald Trump comes into the picture. I was rooting for Hilary, but ultimately at that point in my life, it didn’t affect me that much so him winning was not a big deal. And tbh I don’t even know when I started to get into politics, because I voted for Biden in 2020 but that year was such a blur that I don’t even know how I felt.

But I think it must start in 2022 when the Supreme Court overturned Roe V Wade. I looked into what caused it, and found out it was trump and his justice picks. That’s when it really started. I began looking briefly at some of his campaign in 2016 and just seeing the lying, pretentious, pos he really is. 

But I ultimately didn’t pay that much attention. I figured if Biden won once, then he could win again. But we all know how that turned out.

I was so excited to see Kamala Harris running. I truly believed Trump’s cult was dying out, evident by his loss in 2020, that there was no way he’d win. This election would be a slam dunk and a retribution of the 2016 election. So for all 107 days of her campaign as well as every day since, I’ve kept a close eye on the him, with each new rally and piece of misinformation further cementing my hatred of him and his dumbass followers

The fucking insult to injury is that he doesn’t even fucking campaign. He talks about literally nothing for hours and people eat it up. In a normal world his campaign would’ve ended so many times. Need I remind you that this made jacked off a microphone and pretended to suck it? Fucking hell.

I’ve never gotten to experience it because literally 76 million people voted for him and all of them are usually batshit crazy.

Because it seems like from an ideological standpoint no republican or democrat should ever get along? But the two party system is apparently so integral to the backbone of the country that we just have to push against each other for eternity?

ShaneKaiGlenn,Social Darwinist Oligarchs are a bigger threat than Christian Nationalists right now,"It seems clear to me that a subset of the ultra-wealthy may actually want American society to collapse, paving the way for a techno-autocracy where oligarchs rule. A key text influencing this ideology appears to be *The Sovereign Individual,* written in the late 1990s by William Rees-Mogg and James Dale Davidson. The book didn’t merely predict the disruptions that information technology would bring—it embraced them, rooting for a future where inequality, competition, and instability would dominate.

The authors envisioned a world where governments crumble, taxes vanish, and welfare states become “unfinanceable.” In their harsh vision, only the ""sovereign individual""—a self-reliant, technologically adept elite—would thrive. As *The Guardian* put it:

[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/nov/09/mystic-mogg-jacob-rees-mogg-willam-predicts-brexit-plans](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/nov/09/mystic-mogg-jacob-rees-mogg-willam-predicts-brexit-plans)

&gt;“By 2010 or thereabouts, welfare states ‘will simply become unfinanceable.’ … In such a harsh world, only the most talented, self-reliant, technologically adept person – ‘the sovereign individual’ – would thrive.”

The book gained little traction in late-1990s Britain, dismissed as melodramatic and out of touch with the era’s optimism. But it found a warmer reception in the U.S., particularly among Silicon Valley libertarians. Peter Thiel, co-founder of PayPal, cited *The Sovereign Individual* as one of the most influential books in his life, praising its startlingly accurate predictions about cryptocurrency, digital identities, and even bots. As Rees-Mogg and Davidson predicted:

&gt;“\[A\] ‘new digital form of money’ \[would\] consist of encrypted sequences … unique, anonymous and verifiable … tradable at a keystroke in a multitrillion-dollar wholesale market without borders.”

Sound familiar? Bitcoin arrived a decade later.

Thiel, however, doesn’t just buy into techno-libertarianism; he’s also wrestled publicly with Christianity’s role in shaping ""wokeness."" In an interview reported by *Mediaite*, Thiel said:

[https://www.mediaite.com/news/billionaire-gop-donor-peter-thiel-blames-christianity-for-wokeness-it-always-takes-the-side-of-the-victim/](https://www.mediaite.com/news/billionaire-gop-donor-peter-thiel-blames-christianity-for-wokeness-it-always-takes-the-side-of-the-victim/)

&gt;“Christianity ... always takes the side of the victim. … Maybe you should think of wokeness as ultra-Christianity or hyper-Christianity. It’s an extreme intensification. … The past is terrible, and you can never overcome it.”

Thiel seems to see ""wokeness"" as a kind of mutated Christianity—focused on sin, victimhood, and moral judgment without forgiveness.

This leaves us in a precarious spot. Christian nationalism, with its regressive social agenda, is troubling enough. But a future shaped by social Darwinists like Thiel—who see safety nets and compassion as obstacles—could be even darker. Right now, both forces seem to be jockeying for influence over “Weekend at Trumpy’s,” with the likes of Elon Musk and Thiel cozying up to Trump in ways Christian Nationalists can only dream of.

Whichever side wins the most influence, the rest of us stand to lose.

Christian nationalism is a plague, but if social darwinists take control, things will get truly dark IMO. They want the destruction of any and all social safety nets.

The difference is that rightwing Christians want the Church to provide the safety net, not the government. The government is perceived as a threat to their power and ability to provide that, even if churches only provide a minimal safety net on their terms, and are often designed in ways to enhance their authority and can be exploitive.

Whereas social darwinists literally don't want social safety nets at all... they want survival of the fittest.",79,0.94,31,1732030707,Liberal

neepster44,AI's Solution to the 2024/2028 Election,"Like most of you, I am just about DONE with MAGA and the GOP and our gullible citizens.  I am at a loss for how to counter their strategy of constant lying, so I went to AI for help.  I think its response has some interesting strategies, so I am copying it here.  Sorry if this breaks some sub rule.

Here's my question: ""So, recently Donald Trump (the Republican Candidate) won the 2024 election over Kamala Harris (the Democratic Candidate).  From what I can tell he mostly won by spouting an impossible number of lies that were effectively unchallengable because of the sheer number of them.  This allowed his followers to pick and choose which things they wanted to believe about him, while his opponent had to pick a few stances and then either stick with them or be chastised for them.  Use your logical, mathematical mind to determine how Kamala Harris or a future Democratic candidate could successfully counter this strategy.""

The response: 
""Countering a strategy built on an overwhelming volume of misinformation and narrative control requires a structured, multi-layered approach that addresses both the dynamics of truth and human psychology. Here’s a logical breakdown of what Kamala Harris or a future Democratic candidate could do:
1. Prioritize Narrative Simplicity and Consistency

    The Problem: An avalanche of lies is overwhelming because it exploits the cognitive bias of simplicity. Lies that resonate with existing biases are easier for people to remember.
    The Solution:
        Develop 3–5 core themes that resonate emotionally and are easily repeatable (e.g., ""Working for Every American"").
        Use repetition to create cognitive stickiness. Every appearance, speech, and media opportunity should circle back to these core themes.
        Frame responses to attacks within this narrative. For example, ""That's another distraction; we're focused on [core theme].""

2. Use Selective Fact-Checking Strategically

    The Problem: Countering every lie can lead to fatigue or the ""illusory truth effect,"" where repetition makes lies seem true.
    The Solution:
        Choose to debunk high-impact lies that can cause measurable harm or derail the core message.
        Use a ""truth sandwich"" approach: Start with the truth, briefly debunk the lie, and return to the truth.
        Collaborate with trusted media and fact-checking platforms to preemptively debunk repeated falsehoods.

3. Humanize the Campaign

    The Problem: Broadly targeted lies thrive because they lack specific emotional grounding.
    The Solution:
        Focus on individual stories and human connections. Highlight real people and how policies affect them directly.
        Deploy surrogates (trusted community voices, not just politicians) to amplify these stories and refute misinformation within their circles.

4. Leverage Data and Analytics

    The Problem: Lies spread because they are emotionally engaging, often through targeted digital campaigns.
    The Solution:
        Employ micro-targeted ads to reach key demographics with messages tailored to counter misinformation in their specific contexts.
        Monitor misinformation trends using AI and analytics tools to identify and counter viral narratives quickly.

5. Strengthen Institutional Trust

    The Problem: Lies undermine trust in institutions, making it easier for false narratives to thrive.
    The Solution:
        Position the campaign as a force for institutional renewal and reform. Avoid defensiveness; instead, advocate for transparency and accountability.
        Partner with trusted non-political organizations to communicate key messages.

6. Call Out the ""Flood of Lies""

    The Problem: People may not notice the volume and strategy behind misinformation unless it is explicitly pointed out.
    The Solution:
        Introduce the concept of ""lie overload"" into public discourse. Use humor or metaphors (e.g., ""trying to drink truth from a firehose of lies"").
        Highlight patterns of dishonesty rather than individual claims, framing them as disrespectful to voters.

7. Emphasize Unity and Forward-Looking Optimism

    The Problem: Lies can create polarization and fear, which motivates voters to cling to familiar narratives.
    The Solution:
        Offer a vision that is positive, inclusive, and solution-oriented.
        Use optimistic messaging to contrast with the chaos and divisiveness sown by misinformation.

8. Pre-Bunk Before Debunk

    The Problem: Lies often take hold because they meet people unprepared.
    The Solution:
        Anticipate likely misinformation themes and preemptively address them with facts and framing before they gain traction.
        For example, before a false claim about taxes emerges, emphasize, ""We're ensuring tax fairness for working families while billionaires pay their share.""

By sticking to these strategies, a Democratic candidate can navigate the challenges of a misinformation-heavy campaign while maintaining integrity and effectiveness. Ultimately, the goal is to frame the campaign as an advocate for the truth and solutions, rather than just reacting to falsehoods.""",55,0.84,19,1731974811,Liberal

progressiveprepper,"Yes, There is a Difference between Liberal and Conservative Brains (It's the Amygdala)","Dozens of studies have been done on the difference between liberal and conservative brains with MRI imaging all over the world - and the word they've coined for it is: ""Neural Partisanship"". Multiple research studies show that Conservatives have a slightly larger amygdala - the brain’s emotion and fear processing center. The difference is small - but has large impact on how Conservatives see the world. This slight enlargement makes Conservatives more reactive to what they perceive as ""threats"". (This is not to say there are not other factors, life experiences, that influence them. But neurobiology provides a framework about our predisposition to certain positions.

The amygdala is also responsible for gearing ""flight/fight"" responses under the influence of the cortisol produced by the adrenal glands. Most of these studies were done by linking participants to MRI machines and observing their neural reactions. Some researchers got so good at interpreting the data that they could tell if a person leaned Liberal or Conservative just by observing how neural pathways lit up during the session. 

The amygdala acts like the brain’s alarm system for everyone. When it detects a threat, it springs into action, triggering our fight-or-flight response. In the context of anger, the amygdala is often the first to sound the alarm, setting off a cascade of emotional and physiological responses.  Change is often perceived as a threat and is a stressor for many people, but for Conservatives it's something to which they are very sensitive. Their response to a perceived threat will typically be greater than a Liberal brain. 

**Cue the media.** 

Conservatives don't typically leave their news ""bubble"" - they watch Fox, OAN, NewMax, and others. who feed them fear-mongering news in a continuous stream which often generates fear and anxiety. (They don't call it ""rage media"" for nothing.) Being fed ""threats"" - to themselves, their families and their country -  24/7 leads to high cortisol production 24/7. Essentially, all this means  is that their brains are marinated in fear, anxiety and that they will often respond to threats with anger, rather than a reasoned consideration of the issue.

**\[On a personal note, it is absolutely amazing how triggered Conservatives get when you give them this information. I was called a ""moron"" and ""bitch"" by one man who then went on to quote Scripture talking about how Jesus approved of ""war"". I was invited to ""go outside and have my face punched in"" -  just in the last few days...so  - apparently even having a discussion about the source of their political orientation produces a rage reaction in them. Seriously over the top anger...\]**

The following are additional notes from the studies in no particular order - and they explain so much when we look at the predispositions of Conservatives and Liberals.

""One interesting study found that, compared to liberals, conservatives show a ""larger volume of gray matter in the right amygdala (rAMG), a region that plays a critical role in the processing of negative, aversive human emotions like sadness, fear, and threat, and less gray matter in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a region linked to error monitoring, belief updating, and affect-regulation.”

""Liberals and conservatives differ in their neural interpretations of political concepts.""

""Conservatives are worse at distinguishing truths and falsehoods than liberals.""

""Conservatives have greater psychological resilience attributable to greater impulse control and causal reasoning.""

""Conservatives, compared to liberals, see scientific and non-scientific viewpoints as closer in legitimacy."" (Note: In other words, if your medical doctors tells you one thing about your medical condition, and the guy you're sitting next to in the casino tells you something different...Conservatives are more likely to give them both the same weight. Anyone remember COVID?)

""Liberals show greater cognitive flexibility than conservatives, meaning they have a greater ability to appropriately and efficiently adjust their behavior according to a changing environment.“

""In moral judgments, conservatives emphasize value of actions, while liberals emphasize value of expected outcome.""

""Liberals solve problems more via insight than step-by-step analysis.""

""Conservatives give more weight to negative information than positive information, compared with liberals.""

""Individual political attitudes correlate with physiological traits, such as sensitivity to sudden noises and threatening visual images.""

""When faced with a conflict, liberals are more likely than conservatives to alter their habitual response when cues indicate it is necessary.""

""Liberals focus on the future more than the past, while conservatives focus on the past more than the future.""

""Conservatives and liberals react similarly to positive incentives, but conservatives have greater sensitivity to negative stimuli.""

""Reliance on quick, efficient, and “low effort” thought processes yields conservative ideologies, while effortful and deliberate reasoning yields liberal ideologies.""

**What does this mean for the future?**

Well, we need to acknowledge that they don't have a lot of control over their biological fear/anxiety responses. But they are still responsible for their language and behavior. They are riding high right now - but it is incredibly difficult to have a discussion with someone who is kept in a heightened state of fear and rage - and who can't break their addiction to right-wing media. 

I wish I had more answers, but for now, if we can just understand some of their physiological responses and understanding how their brains react - it will be a step in the right direction. Stop trying to reason, argue, discuss, point out harm, economic disaster, etc. They don't even hear it. They just perceive those as ""Liberal threats"", become angry and you will have accomplished nothing except raising your own blood pressure.

StayAtHomePlantDaddy,Elon Musk's Experiment in Chaos,"Elon Musk’s acquisition of Twitter was a corporate melodrama of hubris and miscalculation. Forced into the $44 billion deal after an ill-fated public declaration of interest—and a subsequent legal entanglement—Musk found himself trapped. The deal drained a substantial portion of his wealth, publicly tethered him to a troubled platform, and bruised his reputation. Tesla, the crown jewel of his empire, saw its stock dip as investors questioned his judgment and priorities. To many, the world's richest man now seemed outmaneuvered, exposed, and mocked on the very platform he now owned.

But Musk, a man who thrives on reinvention, channeled his humiliation into calculated revenge—not just against those who mocked him, but against the entire system he saw as flawed and hypocritical. If the acquisition of Twitter had turned him into a global punchline, he would reshape the punchline into a weapon.

Over time, the platform transformed under his guidance—chaotic, polarizing, and riddled with policy decisions that seemed less about business strategy and more about dismantling cultural norms. Musk's motivations became inscrutable, but one pattern emerged: he sought to amplify voices that promised upheaval, regardless of their political orientation. He reconnected with figures like Donald Trump, whose populist appeal and chaotic energy mirrored Musk’s own ethos of disruption.

It wasn’t ideological. Musk didn’t care about partisan divides; he cared about breaking the status quo. America had humiliated him, and now he would humiliate America. In funding Trump’s political resurgence, Musk wasn’t endorsing a candidate—he was creating a spectacle. His millions flowed into the campaign not to champion a cause but to watch the world’s most powerful democracy devour itself.

Kamala Harris wasn’t defeated by Donald Trump. She was outmaneuvered by Elon Musk’s shadowy influence. Musk’s resources, his platform, and his vendetta shaped the electoral landscape. The election wasn’t just a contest of ideologies; it was a stage for Musk’s experiment in chaos.

As the dust settled, Musk stood apart, watching a world he had pushed toward the brink. Was it revenge, sociopathy, or the perverse thrill of proving that even the most powerful systems could be puppets to his whims? Musk’s actions defied easy categorization, but the consequences were clear: he wasn’t just a tech mogul anymore. He had become something else entirely—a kingmaker, a chaos agent, a man whose wounds fueled his quest to reshape the world in his image.

And for those who had once mocked him, that was the cruelest irony of all.",51,0.74,36,1731768165,Liberal

My parents (70s M/F) and sister (30F) are all republican and my sister has recently gotten pretty hardcore (heartbreaking tbh - I don't recognize her)... I asked for advice in another thread and ended up getting a lot of ""put family above politics"" type responses which I found to be completely unhelpful. To anyone else having the same issues in their family, I found a good resource from SPLC. I've decided that I will have a zero tolerance policy in my home for racism (casual or overt), homophobic, transphobic, anti-immigrant, misogynistic comments, etc. If I hear it in my home, I will call it out and politely ask them to leave. And if I hear it in their homes, I will tell them I'm uncomfortable with those kind of comments and politely leave. I don't care if they're family... We vote our values and believe their ideology is dangerous. At best, they're putting their party over the safety and health of the most vulnerable in society. At worst, they're actively encourating policies that are going to hurt a lot of people. They aren't just ""opinions"" - these policies have real life consequences.

kk20002,We need to *actually* create Blue MAGA. ,"I’m being dead fucking serious. Perhaps it was my naïveté, but if you had asked me last Monday, I didn’t think we would be here. I gave the American people way too much credit. But we’re here, and the horrors have already started at an alarming rate.

I am posting this from the perspective of someone who grew up Republican and was a Republican staffer on the Hill. I’ve spent time in these spaces. Long story short- it was a long conversion process, but I went from an old school Romney/McCain type to someone who is comfortably just as leftist as AOC. However, that journey has brought me to a place where I’m increasingly infuriated that the Dems don’t seem to fully understand their enemy, nor have they demonstrated the grit needed in a moment like this.

I truly believe we are at a critical moment where the coming months could decide our fate for the rest of our lives. That fat orange fuck has vowed to reshape our country into something none of us would recognize. AND YET- Kamala conceded with barely a peep (despite some actual concerning anomalies imo), Biden is teeheeing with tangerine Hitler in the Oval Office, Warren is TWEETING about how Ol’ Donny Boy broke the law again (he’s a felon??? That’s what criminals do??? HELLO??) and NO ONE seems to be calling for the type of drastic action or leadership that is needed right now. The Republicans are stabbing us to death, and the Dems are handwringing about whether it’s ethical to punch back because “we don’t want to be like them.”

Which brings me to this: if we are to survive, if our home is to survive, we need to somehow find the means to start fighting dirty. And I’m dead fucking serious when I say we actually need a blue MAGA movement. A blue tea party movement. Activists and candidates who are populist, loud, and willing to throw every fucking dirty trick the Republicans have done over the last decade *right back in their faces.* 

I’m talking candidates who insult their opponents and attack establishment Dems on a level not yet seen before. Activists who go to elected official offices with the pure intent of creating click bait content to feed our base. Podcasters who make that little Shitler Nick Fuentes and that bald idiot Rogan look tame. A multi prong, ruthless approach, with the end goal of making the Dems cower like the MAGA fuckers cucked the Republicans. And none of this fucking infighting- everyone falls in line. Everyone supports the movement. If you don’t, you’re fair game too. 

Our country, *our home* is in danger. We need to organize and act accordingly. We need to be as ruthless and dirty and cutthroat as the Republicans have been for years. Fuck your moral high ground. Fuck your norms. If you don’t have the stomach for war, then get the fuck out of our way. Is anyone else with me?

WL661-410-Eng,What I think needs changing,"Some quick thoughts on what I think needs changing:

* Dems need to focus on concrete solutions, and abandon all of the feelings and vibes nonsense.  I could hear it in almost every speech the last 4 years.  Dripping with feelings and warm fuzzies. Just stop.  Propose long-term solutions, or don't even try.  The vast majority of Americans want problem solving, not an emotional bath.  ""A, B, and C are problems, and we think X, Y, and Z will address at least some of it, and here's how, and here's how it gets paid for.""
* DEAL WITH THE BORDER.  I used to think the greatest unforced political error in history was Romney's ""my message is for you, not the 47% of Americans that don't pay taxes.""  Not anymore.  Escorting millions of border crossers into red border states - who then bussed them to blue cities and suburbs -  is now the greatest unforced political error that the free world will ever see.
* Stop marching dudes with mustaches, red lipstick, and dresses in front of voters. I believe most folks don't care what the individual does with their own time, but for the love of god, don't alienate voters like you did.  That was another unforced political error.
* Never again make the mistake of pigeon-holing the other candidate as a nazi or a felon, without proving to voters beyond a shadow of a doubt that your vision of governance (taxation, foreign policy, economic growth measures, etc) is better than theirs.
* Never again run for president and tell voters that you want to raise taxes.  Even if it's only on high earners.  High earners have kids, parents, siblings, friends, and neighbors who all vote also.  If a reporter ever asks a future dem candidate about their position on taxes, the answer should be ""we feel strongly that we need to get the nose of the national debt pointed back into a safer trajectory. We have a list of investments in infrastructure that need to be addressed, but nothing - no bridges, no roads, no dams, no power lines - is going to be replaced if republicans keep eroding the tax base and driving us ever deeper in debt. We're on a bad trajectory, and both sides got us there.""
* Don't ever - ever, ever, ever, ever - ignore inflation again.   ",41,0.62,147,1731345943,Liberal

You poor things. Ya know, the truth may not be as loud, it may get silenced, or get lost in the sauce, but its always out there. You can only cover your tracks so much before things just start coming up. The rich aren't here to save us. Never have been never will be. A job isn't a job anymore when the boss is your government. One person loses their freedoms the rest follows. History has told us this time and time again. Cutting off trade with tariffs and reinforcing immigration will not help a country that depends on trade for survival, but it will cut us off and distance us from the world more. A liberal media purge which you all assume is fake news, or biased against your beliefs, whatever, means you get one sided, biased, misinformation 24/7. There are no checks and balances on media coverage, meaning we get a constant flood of Trumps message. What he wants us to believe. Hes already done it, who are we even kidding, most of you are so delusional and detatched from reality, this is a waste of time even explaining it, while you think that is the ""right thing for America, make America Great again"" there was never anything wrong with America before Trump. People may have had different views but division and conflict hadn't occurred on this level over American politics GLOBALLY until he was a candidate. People played dirty but they didn't play this dirty. Things that have happened over his candidacy, if you would have asked me a decade ago if anything like what hes done or said sounds like an American President, I would say no. Anyone who is old enough, sane enough, smart enough would agree. Like dude Bush was cooler than this. Republicans were different then, had more integrity. Now, as for him helping the economy, bandaid solutions to gaping wound problems. To fix the economy you have to have people who are clean off drugs, people who are EDUCATED, people who are secure, have homes, access to information and resources, this creates job growth, personal growth, and ensures the happiness and growth of your citizens. Businesses with government regulation, have limits on what they can charge, because businesses unregulated can charge whatever, claim whatever, and get off scot free with minimal consequence. What's that mean? Say you order a defibrillator for emergencies and you have a heart condition and it doesn't work, the company that sold it to you isn't liable for faulty products. Pay up. Does anyone remember company stores? Coal camps? Where businesses owned the town, made the cost of living, made the cost of goods? Miserable. Pay up. Our abundance of year round produce like bananas, pineapples, ect. ect. Tariffs. Trade bans. I know you hate admitting you are wrong, I know it goes against your ""God"" or how you were ""raised"" but take away your religion, take away your political views, you are just hateful, ignorant, narcissistic, detatched, facetious, insecure, delusional, sad and angry little person.

They were all so smug about the polls and their findings. Then when trump won, the media turned.

They immediately proclaimed that they were sure all along that Harris would lose. They blamed everyone, including the voters. That's what pissed me off the most. They had the balls to blame those that voted! Talk about total gaslighting. Meanwhile, the right wing media gloats, mocks the liberals, and talks about liberal tears.

ComfortableWage,I keep hearing theories about how 15m people staying home didn't actually stay home and I'm not buying it.,"I'm hearing now that it wasn't the fault of the 15m people who stayed home that Trump won.

I'm not buying it. As I look at Trump numbers, again, I see 74 million votes. That's what he had last time back in 2020. His base has not changed. Going on Joe Rogan didn't change, which, by the way, just want to say I called out Joe Rogan for being a conservative shill a long time ago. 

But I digress. Where are these extra votes going to come from? Harris still sits firmly 4 million votes behind Trump. Eat me. No way she catches up. Those 15 million other votes just stayed home. 

And I agree with the fact that they stayed home because she was a woman. Had she been a man she'd have won this election.

Misogyny is ingrained in America. THAT is why she lost. It's not because she wasn't qualified or what have you. It's because she's a woman.

She was younger, smarter, quicker, and agile... yet she lost to a senile old man who takes a crap anytime someone says something bad about him.

You will never convince me it WASN'T because she was a woman.

I say that as a white, atheist, bi man living in Idaho by the way. So if you want to question my motives for saying this. Go for it.

Edit: I see there are comments here pointing out the racism and yes, I agree, America is racist as shit. But Obama got elected. He was a man. Harris got more votes than Clinton but still couldn't clinch it. This tells me that America is more misogynistic than it is racist. But it is absolutely racist.

the_mist_maker,"Liberals need to stop blaming themselves, and stop blaming Trump voters","There's only one culprit behind why this season turned out the way it did, and it is misinformation. A concentrated, well-funded, scorched-earth campaign of lies that has been carried out from the ground up by Republican leadership.

It starts with Fox News, built up over decades to be a machine that spews out hate-filled lies 24/7 into the ears of the public. It continues with the media ecosystem of small publications, podcasters, and media personalities that echo the Fox News talking points and take it even further, waging the front lines of the culture war out of personal passion, not realizing--or not caring--they're the acting as the gullible patsies of the oligarchs who fund it all. And it is capped, in these years, by Trump himself, the most shameless liar to ever sully the stage of American politics with his presence. Trump, who cannot open his mouth without lying, who has managed to break every record for the number of lies spoken in a single speech, who built his popularity on the back of one Big Lie after another--without hesitating either to intersperse them with a thousand small lies.

It is tempting of course to look at our own leaders and our own policies and try to ask, ""what did we do wrong? What policy could we present differently to appeal to (*insert demographic here*)?"" But this is misguided, because how would any policy hold any appeal if they never know what it is?

It's tempting to look at the facts and the way our leaders spoke about them and say, ""She should have hit this fact harder, driven home this point more clearly!"" But what purpose does that ever serve if they don't know what the facts are?

Similarly, it is tempting to take refuge in the misery-laden moan of, ""Oh, this country is more racists/bigoted/misogynist than I thought it was!"" Certainly Trump actively courts the racist and misogynist vote, but if that were the beginning and end of the story then why did so many minorities and women vote for him? When you ask the rank-and-file voters--not the hardcore bigots--why they voted the way they did, it has to do with economy, policy, the border, and their own wellfare... all hard-and-fast, real-world factors.

Factors they are wrong about. Because of a deliberate campaign of lies.

We'll never be able to move toward a sane government as long as lies reign unchecked across our society. How can you make good decisions if you don't know the truth? And Trump supporters don't need to be unusually ignorant or naive to believe the lies when they're coming from every direction. When you hear the same thing on your preferred big cable TV news program, and from your favorite podcaster, and from your candidate for President (all people who you *should* be able to trust!) you'd have to be crazy to question it!

My theory is a cabal of wealthy oligarchs funded and built this media environment in order to promote policies good for themselves--low taxes on the rich and low regulation on business. In so doing, they have betrayed the trust of the millions of people who look to media for trustworthy information.

And we are never going to move forward as a country (liberal or otherwise!) unless we can undermine this campaign of lies and somehow move back to a shared sense of facts--and ones that are actually based in fact!

So stop blaming bigotry or Harris or Trump voters. Blame the oligarchs who've built this engine of lies for their own benefit.

EducationMental648,How to fight and actually win ,"First ask yourself, “what is a fucking liberal?” 

If you let them define it, then you’re going to lose immediately. Words must mean something and theirs mean nothing. 

A liberal is someone who wants change against what has been. Yes, there are other definitions, but we are gonna be merriam-Webster about this. 

Now the idea that republicans can’t be liberal, isn’t true. Lincoln was a liberal republican. That’s important as the demonization of republicans will most certainly lead into not prying away their base. And prying away is just as important as creating a new movement and trying to get people to follow. 

But we don’t need to create a new movement. There already exist one that is quite liberal. We borrow it. But we don’t return it. 

——

The current state of the world is that the very wealthy literally own everything. Even Republicans acknowledge this but they can’t put their finger on it (talking about voters not the elites who I’m speaking of anyways). Doesn’t matter what country you go to either. Left or right, they own it. 

Even progressive voices acknowledge this. But they  put their focus on more than one topic and then the message becomes lost. 

——
Why is that important? 

Republicans tend to be single issue voters. Dems tend to focus on multiple things but then will hardline towards single issues at the end. So the single issue that has overlap is ….classism. 

And the solution to classism most certainly covers almost all topics and demographics. They have, you don’t. 

——

The pivot must stress classism. You don’t always have to detail it so eloquently as if you were a philosopher being quoted some hundreds of years from now. I wouldn’t do that, as you’ll lose focus of the uneducated. 

Conservative absolutely protect that classist ideology. But don’t attack conservatives themselves, just the belief in “their billionaires.” 

——

Next, we must sooner rather than later, pick someone to lead this. The way we do that is by highlighting them and sharing them everywhere (obviously). We all must brainstorm who that is. But it cannot be Sanders because of age. Ideally, it’s someone middle aged. That gets young and old on board. 60 is not middle aged. Somewhere around 40 is. 

This person must not be elite or come from elites. It must be grassroots. You cannot have them accept from the rich. They must abstain. They essentially cannot be worth millions. 

—— 

If you did not read and only scrolled towards the end, the problem is that liberals (who want to change things) aren’t focusing on the main issue of the fact that the elites of owned things since our country’s birth. That needs to change and we must pivot to stress it. 

Progressives need to understand that a lot of the issues involving civil liberties can change due to solving this issue, and conservatives don’t actually make up much of the country. The parties do. Most people believe in change. 

Economic issues play one of the largest if not the largest, historically and most likely always will. 

——

Edit: but also brainstorm. Don’t just take it from me. But do understand that classism is going to play the biggest role. ",16,0.72,26,1731183342,Liberal

swcollings,"Temporary abortion compromise, followed immediately by massive electoral reform","I suggest we should look at this election loss from a perspective of vote-splitting. It's not the only valid perspective, but there are lessons here.

We can approximate the country into four quadrants divided along two axes: pro-life/pro-choice, pro-democracy/anti-democracy. The pro-choice/pro-democracy party is the institutional Democratic Party. The pro-life/pro-democracy people explicitly aren't allowed in that club, because the Party refuses to (as they would put it) compromise on women's rights, and the pro-life crowd won't compromise on the issue either. The anti-democracy people are the institutional Republican Party, and were able to work together better regardless of their pro-life/pro-choice stance. So now we have effectively three parties, in a system built for two, and vote-splitting screws the entire pro-democracy camp.

The correct solution is for the Democratic Party to compromise on the pro-life/pro-choice axis, on an *explicitly temporary* basis. Allow pro-life candidates back into the party, on the condition that once the Democratic Party gains power in any state or at a federal level, it should immediately begin a defined program of massive systematic reform, which includes reforms that make the system function with more than two parties. (No more first-past-the-post, approval voting FTW, among other solutions.) After that, the pro-life and pro-choice wings can safely part ways, but still opportunistically cooperate, without handing the entire government over to the fascists.

The GOP became the party of Trump due to vote-splitting; he won the 2016 primary with only 40% of the votes cast. The GOP didn't fix the problem, they doubled down.

My statement can be summarized as follows: 

I am a Taiwanese-American dual citizen who could not care less about which western politician digs their own country's grave, I only take interest when Taiwan and South Korea are at risk of being buried in said grave. I did not vote for Trump, and I did not vote for Harris, therefore I did not vote against LGBTQ and women's interests nor did I vote against gun owners', and constitutionalist's interests. (I will not tell anyone if I voted third party or if I just left the presidential candidate slot blank).

Will you take up arms or at least support the insurgency's war effort?

I asked that question on my instagram story, I put it as a caption overlaid on the [French Resistance drive by scene](https://youtu.be/iMrk0twBLd8?si=lbQSz2cuESkbRb58&amp;t=55) from the Great Escape movie, and on the next slides included [Squad gameplay](https://youtu.be/npNMxeRCZ74?si=Zy_B07Rhrs5_RF5V&amp;t=92) and [Ukrainian infantry machine gunner footage](https://youtu.be/wVYXa3zN2As?si=sFK5uExQm67Jykvx&amp;t=325) to emphasize what real world warfare could be like.

If you truly think that we are witnessing the emergence of American facism, you see political violence as not merely a possiblity but a certainty. I'm not attempting to make a claim here for or against fascism being on the horizon, just that is what saying that it is would imply.

SwimmingThroughHoney,My rant about the Reddit bubble and things,"# **CHANGE** We can believe in

Like many are, I'm frustrated by the election. But at this point I'm also frustrated by the reactions on many subs both before and after the election.

## Polls
I spent a lot of time on the main politics sub. A lot of my Reddit activity was on that sub. I had been posting that the polls were showing a close race as far back as the beginning of this year. And I reiterated that point up until election day. And every time people would respond with various excuses why the polls would be ignored. And the excuses followed an extremely predictable progression: It's too early for the polls to be accurate -&gt; Biden hasn't started campaigning yet -&gt; Harris just started campaigning -&gt; The polls aren't accurate -&gt; The polls are being flooded with bad data. The NYT came out with that one poll that people said was terrible, and should be completely ignored, because it oversampled conservative voters, which completely missed the point of what the poll was trying to accomplish.

## Election Day
As soon as the Florida results came in and showed an unexpected hard shift to the right, I felt things looked bad. I commented that it could be a bad portent of what was to come. People were completely ignoring massive shifts in results (like Miami-Dade). But people scoffed and literally said I was dooming. On the NYT map, even before the swing states really started reporting in larger numbers, you could see the mass of red arrows indicating shifts to the right across the board. But nope, doesn't mean much because the swing states could still be different. People kept repeating that it was just like the 2020 red mirage, but completely ignored how the red mirage in that election happened in the first place (and why it wasn't happening again this election).

## Voters
People frequently posted questions (and are still doing it) about ""How do people *still* vote for Trump"". I think this is probably one of the major points that people just do not seem to get. Yes, Trump has a (relatively) small core of hard-core supporters. They know what he says, what his policies are and will do, and embrace it all because they want exactly that. But the vast majority of people vote for him because they have no exposure to politics. They don't know what Trump says, his policies, his actions, etc. And it's very difficult to get through to those people. How do you break through to people who ignore politics? It's a catch-22 situation. Because of this, they do not understand the rhetoric of him being an authoritarian or why his policies will be harmful.

And this is where the left's, particularly on Reddit, messaging completely breaks down and becomes harmful. Because these people don't understand the reasons, calling them fascists or bigots has no context. They are being labeled as something for reasons that are completely unknown to them. It gives them no incentive to vote for your candidate, or vote at all, when they see one side attacking them (or what is viewed as attacking).

What they do know is that Trump has told them he will bring about a change that will improve the aspects of their lives that are important to them. The policies are irrelevant. The actions are irrelevant. They want change.

Which brings me back to the first line:

## **CHANGE** We can believe in

This was the campaign slogan for Obama in 2008. It's a brilliant slogan because it's exactly what point want: Change. The specifics don't matter. ""Change"" means different things for different people and people want change that will improve their lives. Trump's campaign pushed change. He told people what they wanted to hear, and they rewarded him for it.

And it's also why Harris' slogan was a fucking disaster: ""We're not going back"". This is *exactly* what people want though. They want to go back to before inflation and before things cost so much. They want to go back to when people didn't call them fascists. It doesn't matter the reasons for those things happening now. What matters is what the people want. Sure, she tried to address those things, by pointing out what Biden has passed that helped the economy and protections for various civil rights. But it's a horrible campaign strategy. People do not view the economy and their own personal expenses as the same thing. Ask people how the CHIPS Act or how the BBB Act has improved their lives, you wont get an answer. So telling them that those things did is useless. And Harris ever saying that she'll continue Biden's work or do the same things was incredibly stupid. You don't tell people who are demanding change (whatever that ""change"" may be) that you're not going to change. Of course they wont vote for you then.

Reddit is not reality. Neither is Twitter/X, Facebook, or any other social media. No doubt they're all bubbles in their own right. But if liberals really want to encourage voters to support them, they need to stop labeling people regardless of whether it's right or wrong or true or not: It simply does not work. The last 3 elections are proof of that.

Redditors need to break out of the bubble that exists here. Polling for the past 10 months gave indication that Democrats were going to have trouble, and yet were shocked when that's exactly what happened. Ignoring that did not change reality. Ignoring that people were frustrated with the state of things did not change reality. People were going to vote for Trump because of it and simply labeling them with negative titles to try and guilt them to vote for Harris accomplished nothing.

Part of the problem is where people interact with others too. On Reddit, it's a lot of polar opposites: hard left with hard right. So of course it gets a bit contentious. But out in the real world it's different. If you want Average Joe to see your side, acknowledge that shit can suck right now. Both you and him probably wish groceries were cheaper. Your ideas on how to fix it likely differ, but you have to start somewhere. And just discarding him and calling him a fascist for supporting the guy who *claims* that he'll improve Joe's life sure isn't going to make Joe want to do anything you suggest to him.

Fixing the problems, I know, goes well beyond just getting out of the bubble. But it's a start to understanding that simply moving forward with the same mentality isn't going to suddenly work.",15,0.83,15,1731010437,Liberal
blastmemer,Another Rant - STOP EXTERNALIZING BLAME,"After the 2016 election I was, like most liberals, at a complete loss as to what happened and felt like I lacked any understanding of the American electorate. I was incredibly disappointed in my fellow Americans. I still am. But we’ve had *eight years* to figure them out how to persuade them to vote this infantile sociopath out of public life. We failed miserably at doing the *things that are under control* to win. I’m so sick of hearing about the things that are *not* under our control, like inflation, the economy, the right wing media, and the intelligence/ignorance/gullibility of the electorate. For the love of god can we focus on  **addressing the concerns of the American electorate* as they are, not as we want them to be, instead of constantly trying to deflect or explain them away. Even worse is chastising people for having concerns. There are always going to be external factors that influence elections. Tough sh*t. 

The American electorate is **economically populist and socially moderate**. For the social progressives here, you don’t have to like it but you do have to accept reality. We need a **simple and positive message that matches the will of the American electorate**. 

Examples:

1. Immigration. 

“We love legal immigration. It’s been the backbone of our country forever. We want a fair system where people can legally emigrate. However we will not tolerate lawlessness and will strictly enforce our borders. I wish we would have addressed this earlier but we are serious now. And by the way, we have a great bill that Republicans failed to pass.” 

2. Inflation. 

Yes: “I know the American people are hurting. The problem is wages have not kept up with inflation. [insert populist message]

No: “It’s not a big deal, it’s slowed down to normal now!”  

3. Social issues. 

Yes: “Yeah, some of us got a little out of hand during the pandemic era, but the Democratic Party categorically rejects the lawlessness of the defund the police movement and rejects government overreach in imposing social values on others. We reject identity politics and are here for everyone!”

No: “Uhh, next question.” 

4. Media/social media. 

Yes: “We categorically reject government censorship of social media, outside of state secrets and other serious stuff like that. We are not your big brother. We believe in freedom. Yes I’ll absolutely go on Joe Rogan and even light up a joint!” 

No: “another GOP talking point - I can’t believe you idiots are falling for it! Rogan!? Sounds risky!”.

5. Freedom. 

“We are the party of freedom! Let’s legalize weed! Also online gambling! We will protect your porn! And obviously, a woman’s right to choose! The GOP will do none of this. *They* want to be your big brother, not us.” 

6. Trump. 

Yes: “He doesn’t give a shi*t about you. He cares about golfing and doesn’t even like to read.” 

No: “He’s a fascist/racist!” 

The bottom line is we have to address issues as they are brought up - *even if they are brought up in bad faith* by the GOP. Deflecting and pointing out they are being brought up to manipulate and don’t really matter to many people’s lives - *even if true* - is an absolutely awful strategy that has played a large role in leading to this disaster. We are not being manipulated into *responding* to culture war and other issues, we are being manipulated into *not responding* and taking an actual stance on these issues because the GOP knows it looks bad when we do it. It’s not that hard folks: if something seems to matter to people, address it head on with an economically populist and socially moderate standpoint. Do not deflect and externalize blame. End rant.

SpiritualCopy4288,A quick lesson on trump’s appeal,"Think of the brain like a car with two drivers: the logical driver (the prefrontal cortex) and the emotional driver (the amygdala). When things feel intense or uncertain, it’s like the logical driver takes a backseat, and the emotional driver grips the wheel, steering toward what feels safe and familiar, even if it doesn’t make sense logically.

For many conservative voters, the GOP is like that well-known road they’ve driven a hundred times. Even if there’s construction, potholes, or signs saying “danger,” the familiarity of the path makes it feel safer than the new route. They’re not stopping to read all the signs because the emotional brain just wants to stick with what feels like home.

So, when you’re seeing people make these choices, it’s less about intelligence and more about which “driver” in the brain is steering the car.",0,0.44,16,1730940479,Liberal
superkrizz77,Off my chest,"To those that voted Trump or third party candidate, or Democrats who didn't vote. You have now:

\- Severely weakened the global fight against climate change. Thought Helene was bad? You've doomed your fellow Americans to increasing frequency and severity of hurricanes, floods, wild fires and other extreme weather. The same goes for vulnerable countries and regions across the world. This will get worse every year, until large swathes of the US (and the world) will become inhabitable.

\- Betrayed your daughters, wives and mothers, as the GOP will strip away women's rights step by step. Same goes for any other minority in the US.

\- Very likely started a global economic war. If Trump goes ahead with his plans to put tariffs on everything, this will exacerbate a global economic war. It will increase inflation, likely increase interest rates globally, increase unemployment. You probably didn't know, but the Great Depression was caused by economic isolationism and tariffs.

\- Killed or critically wounded NATO. No European ally will trust the US from this point. We're on our own, and so are you.

\- Possibly doomed Ukraine to become a Russian vassal state. You probably don't care, because you do not possess the acumen to understand how this undermines Europe, which used to be your main allies, friends and trade partners.

\- Doomed Palestinians to an even worse genocide. The tragedy of this choice by third party candidate voters is bottomless.

\- Significantly exacerbated the decline and potential death of US democracy.

You did this because you are uninformed/misinformed, extremely cynical or just dumb. There is no excuse for what you have done, every man and woman has a responsibility to learn and understand, in order to employ your vote in the best possible way for your fellow human beings, and nature. You failed that horribly.

This is such a sad, sad day. I feel so bad for those that voted Blue, and for those that will suffer going forward. But this will badly affect the entire world, not only the US, and what you've done cannot be forgiven.

MarquisEXB,When can we talk about the 12M-15M people who voted for Biden and didn't vote for Hillary or Harris as being due to sexism/unconscious bias?,"Trump had nearly the same amount of votes (72M in 2024 so far, 74M in 2020), while Hillary (66M in 2016) and Kamala (67M in 2024) both underperformed from Biden's win (81M in 2020). It seems highly unlikely that both the turnout overall was lower AND Trump converted people from D to R. So the loss was due to a lack of enthusiasm on the Democratic side. I know people will say it's the Comey effect for Hillary and try to lump the economy/immigration/LGBTQ rights for Harris. But that seems to be less likely given the enthusiasm bump she should have gotten from Trump's campaign antics, Roe v Wade, replacing Biden, a great VP pick, etc.

Can we just admit that a good portion of this is to be due to their gender?

And I know some people will state reasons why they didn't like her. Hillary was ""unlikeable"" and people are saying that Kamala ""didn't connect with me"", but both of those are subjective and likely due to unconscious sexism. People didn't have to say ""I'll never vote for a woman"" for it to be sexism. They could just find reasons that they didn't like Hillary/Harris that they wouldn't have found if they were men.

SpiritualCopy4288,Election Day 2024: A Few Thoughts to Keep Us Grounded Today.,"

Today’s an intense one—no sugarcoating it. We’re all watching the results roll in with a mix of hope, nerves, and maybe a bit of exhaustion. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed when so much is on the line, but let’s take a moment to step back and remember a few things.

First, we’ve already moved the needle in so many ways. No matter what happens tonight, we’ve seen progress over the last few years that didn’t just happen by chance. It happened because people fought for it, showed up, and stayed engaged. Change is slow, frustratingly so sometimes, but every cycle we’re part of it. Voting is one step—what we’re building goes beyond today.

Second, don’t underestimate the power of a long game. The path to lasting change has always been two steps forward, one step back. Look at history—most of the progress we’ve made came from people who kept showing up, even after tough losses. Our voices aren’t going anywhere after tonight. If we want a future that reflects our values, our support for progressive causes, candidates, and policies will continue regardless of the outcome.

Finally, remember that we’re in this together. The most meaningful changes come from people like us working at every level—in our communities, local elections, and, yes, even in the halls of Congress. It’s not about one candidate or one election; it’s about building a movement that stays strong beyond election cycles.

So let’s hang in there today, support each other, and keep showing up for the values we believe in. Whatever happens tonight, we’ll regroup, we’ll keep fighting, and we’ll keep moving forward.",34,0.77,9,1730838787,Liberal

Time and time again the right has exposed themselves without even knowing it. 

Choice is such a visceral issue to them. So personal. Well it should be because they hate everything they are not. 

They hate Obama because he’s cool, they hate Hollywood and Beyoncé because she has style and they don’t. They hate people who are just effortlessly charming and charismatic…considering they have to try so hard.

 They hate brown people…well because they are racist so they just hate brown people. 

They hate women. They hate women a lot. They hate women who have gotten or who will need an abortion in the future. They hate women because they never got laid in highschool. They have received very little female attention and they hate the world because of it. 

It’s true. Look at the ones who are most against abortion…not exactly dripping with rizz. They feel if they aren’t getting any no one should…which just confirms they truly believe all women needing an abortion are loose irresponsible whores who make bad decisions.

When she flinched away he immediately moved forward more to kiss her anyway. A small movement? Maybe. But it speaks volumes about him that this is his natural, automatic reaction when a girl pulls away from him, dodges or pushes back. We’ve seen him do it before.

I don't know about you, but if my wife, who is always glad to have a kiss or hug were to back away when I tried to, even with all our familiarity, my reaction would be to stop. I might be a little confused and wonder why, just since she is usually fine with it. But my reflexive response certainly wouldn't be to move forward more and kiss her anyway. Even less if it was a date with someone, and even far less if it was a kid I didn't know. Really it's kind of weird trying to kiss someone else's kid in the first place.

Best-Subject-7253,“Vote for whoever gets you closer to your end goal”,"ONCE upon a time (approximately 4 years ago) I was talking to my politically centrist uncle. I was at his house doing some repairs on his banister, which wasn’t holding up to the rigors of 3 children in the house.  We started talking politics.  Something we typically avoid in my  family. 

I told him how I was planning on voting 3rd party for that presidential election.  I was standing on my high horse proclaiming my protest vote, and complaining about how much I hated my options.  That “politicians needed to do better if they wanted to win my vote”. 

That’s when he said something to me, turning that day into a core memory.  “I typically vote for whoever is going to get me closer to the finish line”.  

Why was this so profound to me?  It feels like it should have been obvious.

HOW often do we hear people talk about choosing the ""lesser evil."" It’s a phrase that weighs heavily on all of us, making it feel like we’re stuck between two unappealing options. I get it—it’s frustrating and disheartening to feel like you’re settling for someone who doesn’t fully represent your values. But I want to share a different perspective with you: instead of looking at it as picking the lesser of two evils, think of it as voting for the person who can help us get closer to where we want to be.

This has completely changed the way I vote, and the way I feel about voting.  This little change in my thought process has helped me realize that there is no quick way to the finish line.  We aren’t going to travel miles into progress over night.  The fight for freedom and equality is a game of inches. Another way to think about it is climbing up a ladder is a lot slower than falling off a ladder.

I fully believe the phrase “Voting for the lesser evil” is a term coined by bad actors. The number of times it’s been pushed on us through social media is not by accident.  It’s designed to make you feel regret, and resignation.  You don’t have to feel this way. Casting your vote for the candidate that keeps you closer to your goals is a noble thing, and you should be proud of it. Often times you will find when you vote this way your goals come into view faster than you expect.

When I think about my vote in this way, I get a sense of empowerment. I’m not just a passive participant in a flawed system; I’m part of a movement. It encourages me not just to vote but to get involved in my community, to advocate for the policies I believe in, and to engage in conversations that matter. My vote is just one piece of a larger puzzle, and I want to help fit those pieces together.

So, the next time you’re preparing to vote, or if you haven’t yet voted in this election; remember this: you’re not just choosing the lesser evil. You’re making a choice that brings you closer to the future you want to see.",82,0.9,14,1730348246,Liberal

AequusEquus,Learn from my mistakes - don't lose your ability to vote,"Edit: Thank you to everyone who commented with helpful resources. I contacted the League of Women Voters, who helped me discover that I am actually eligible for a limited ballot! I cast my vote this morning :)

Several months ago, my relationship came to an abrupt end due to domestic violence.

I had to move 250 miles away from the city I called home for 12 years, back in with my parents. I have been making an effort to spend quality time with my aging and sickly mother while I'm here, in spite of how unhappy I am with the environment and circumstances that led me here. I took her out for lunch, and I was instantly rewarded by being pulled over on the way there. Rather than issuing me a warning (given that I was in an area that I'm unfamiliar with, had not yet seen a speed limit sign on the road I'd just turned on, was mirroring the speed of others around me, and in spite of the fact that people constantly drive recklessly at 90+ mph on the freeway I had just exited), I was issued a speeding ticket and a stern warning that I'm legally required to update my ID address within 30 days of moving.

I had specifically held off on updating my address because I do not know how long I will be staying with my parents before finding a new place to live, and because I was worried that, due to how close to the election we are, it would interfere with my ability to vote. After the ticket, I felt pressured to update my address in case of legal consequences if I happened to be pulled over again (cops around here don't seem to do much other than treat citizens like piggy banks), so I caved and followed orders. I requested that my voter registration be updated at the same time, thinking that I was dotting my I's and crossing my T's.

I showed up to the local polling station yesterday, completed practice ballot in-hand, and was told that I'm not eligible to vote in this election. I'm not eligible in my prior county of residence. I'm not eligible for statewide office votes that don't have anything to do with my county of residence. I'm not eligible to vote for the fucking president. NOTHING.

I updated my address *one day* after the apparent deadline to be eligible to vote in this election. I've been registered to vote for over 10 years in a different county in the same state I've lived in my entire life, and I've never had an issue previously, so I was not as vigilant as I should have been. 

I'm angry at my ex for causing me to have to move. I'm angry at the cop for being a fucking cop. I'm angry at my state's voter registration requirements. I'm angry at myself for not reviewing the rules more closely. I'm just ANGRY, and there's nothing I can do except be better in the future.

#TLDR; Please learn from my mistakes: either update your address *well* in advance, or risk it for the biscuit and leave it out of date long enough to submit your ballot.

Bovoduch,Is a little illiberalism necessary to protect liberalism?,"Sorry if this touches on points people have brought up before. It has been an issue I have been grappling with pretty hard recently, and wanted to know others thoughts. Seeing how damaging illiberalism has been recently in the world, with much of Europe and America seeing a rise in populism and authoritarian doctrine, I have been wondering what steps are necessary to combat this, even if they are illiberal, with a primary focus on the US bc american. The main issue is lies. Pure lies and misinformation. It is not even a debate that the majority of the right \*relies\* on, supports, and without issue, spreads lies and hate about certain populations. Espouse rhetoric for authoritarian nations, such as Russia, in order to weaken patriotism in the west/US and bolster authoritarian candidates. 

Is it reasonable to make the proposition that limited illiberalism is necessary to protect liberalism? Should we impose laws and mandates on misinformation in the news and from online personalities to curb it? Is it reasonable to mandate that high-viewer personalities be required to publicly disclosed sources of financing, to show everyone who the primary funders of certain information points are? Should we limit people's ability to espouse rhetoric of fascism, specifically Nazis and supremacists? 

Personally, I lean more towards yes. That these limited expansions of power and illiberalism are crucial to curbing the rise of authoritarianism in the west, and protecting liberalism in all other domains. I have no faith in the ""people"" or ""market"" in correcting these things. It ironically has just made it worse. People want fears validated, people want emotions represented. Lies and misinformation does this, and it pays well. The market encourages this rise. Sure, there are other sources pushing honesty, truth, and liberalism. But it hasn't been enough. 

What are we willing to give up to ensure the prosperity of freedom?

jaker9319,"Democrats emphasize policy and ideals vs results / impact too much. Democrats are also unwilling to highlight ""geographic wins"". ","I will preface this by saying that I realize that this is probably an unpopular opinion. I am also just explaining my experience. I'm a liberal Democrat living in a swing state in the Great Lakes region. My friends, family, and co-workers have a wide range of political beliefs and have various backgrounds. One interesting thing that I've noticed is that a lot of liberal Democrats have what I feel like is a warped view of what attracts people to Trump and the Republican party now a days. I'll admit that I had these same beliefs for a long time, but in talking to especially more a-political / moderate independents, it just doesn't seem to be holding up.

Online it seems like a lot of liberal Democrats think that it's just obvious that Democrats are the better choice economically for people who are not in the top 10% income wise. And pretty much better on every other quality of life issue. And therefore assume that any white a-political / independent / really anyone attracted to Trump and Republicans must be attracted to Trump due to his social policies and rhetoric on things like immigration, race, LGBTQ, etc.

I think this is a huge disconnect between what Democrats think attract swing voters to Trump and what actually does. Pretty much all of the radio, tv, and print commercials I'm hearing / reading for Trump focus on the economy. 

Another big thing is this idea that Democrats ruin the quality of life in a place. There seems to be a disconnect where Republicans talk about impact (often in an anecdotal way) / perceived quality of life and Democrats talk about policies / ideals and sometimes data (that is often disconnected from anecdotal impact). This leads to the whole geographic thing. I can't tell you how many times I've heard something like ""Kamala Harris is a Californian liberal. Liberals took states like California, New York, Illinois, Michigan, Pennsylvania (I just saw a comment about liberals destroying Connecticut), etc., and have ruined them. ""Red states"" like Texas, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Kansas, Tennessee, etc., are all doing so much better and they are doing better because of the people, policies, and politics. Democrats in turn tend to just try to either claim these red states as being more blue (or highlight blue cities in them) or say that the ""failing"" states are actually more conservative than people think. Or they might trot out a list of data showing ""blue"" states doing objectively better than ""red"" states. But Republicans are quick to say that basically all Red states that have negative data have negative data because of the Federal government and the civil war. At least where I live there is a pretty common belief (that trends across political beliefs) that the ""liberal"" states I mentioned are way worse than the ""red"" states I mentioned and that this due to the people, politics, and policies of those places (and that naturally/historically those liberal places should be much better and the red places much worse). Also that while Republicans may control ""liberal"" states mentioned (and Democrats ""red"" states I mentioned), this doesn't overcome the idea that the ""liberal"" states are liberal (and their destruction rests at the hands of the Democrats) and the ""red"" states are conservative (and their success rests at the hands of Republicans). 

 I have come across numerous people who say they dislike Trump and a lot of the Republican's messaging but that Republicans just govern better. I get that different personalities are attracted to different parties. And that it's more natural for Republicans to demonize entire states and cities than it is for Democrats. I also get that again probably due to the types of people the Democratic party attracts, Democrats tend to focus on data and policies /ideology. I just wish that Democrats would start focusing how how Republicans have ruined the quality of life for average Americans in places that are both actually controlled by Republican politicians AND are considered ""red"" for the average American. Because Republicans are sure doing that in reverse and it's resonating a lot with swing voters. ",6,0.61,32,1726849174,Liberal

My neighbor does it to.  When a local cat went missing I assumed its demise was the poison in my neighbor's yard.  When people accuse certain groups, such as Haitian immigrants in Springfield, of eating pets or other animals, it seems hypocritical not to also acknowledge the practices of individuals who indiscriminately kill animals, including wildlife, simply for stepping onto their property. Republicans are not talking about respect for life. Why it's socially acceptable for my conservative dad to poison or shoot animals for property protection (or even sport for that matter), while condemning another group (illegals brought here by Harris) for consuming animals as a means of survival or tradition? In both cases, animals are being killed (except that in only one case are they being killed), yet only one practice is sensationalized. ",165,0.91,75,1726697816,Liberal

Personally, I think it's absurd. Unfortunately, there appears to be a few Liberal identifying types who are taking it to heart. I don't know where these ideas are coming from, other than from Republican trolls, but I feel that it is completely unnecessary.

Wanting tthe freedoms enshrined in the US Constitution, to apply equally to all Americans, is not a matter of tolerance. It is a matter belief in the ideals of the Constitution.

There is no ""paradox of tolerance,"" because there is nothing to ""tolerate."" You simply respect the freedoms of others. That's it. If they misbehave, you don't have to tolerate that misbehavior or come up with some wacky ""paradox of tolerance"" to explain it. It is completely unnecessary.

So, can we all let this ""tolerance"" stuff die now? I just want to get back to expressing my vicious intolerance of bigotry again.

*Edit*

Thanks to the kind words and patience of u/Bgc931216 and u/raistlin65,  I think I have resolved this issue for myself at least:

We can choose what we will and will not tolerate. Tolerating one thing doesn't require tolerating all things. ""Selective tolerance"" is valid. So we can selectively tolerate the things in which our iLiberal ideology protects, while employing zero tolerance for the behaviors it does not protect.

**Finding a phone bank**: Go to [https://events.democrats.org/?event\_type=2&amp;show\_all\_events=true](https://events.democrats.org/?event_type=2&amp;show_all_events=true) and find a phone bank and time that works for you. Sign up and you’ll get a Zoom link to join when the session starts.

**Training**: My call (and I believe every call) starts with a training session on how to use the dialer software and how to preview the suggested script for that calling session.  This session was calling voters in PA so the callers let us know ahead of time that some folks might be Trump supporters in case anyone got gruff with us.  We were advised to always be polite and not argue.

**Calling**: They used a website called Scale To Win for the calls. I dialed directly from my browser using the site. I’d recommend using a laptop/desktop for this, but a tablet should work as well.  I used my laptop and headphones and it worked great.  

Callers didn’t see my name or my phone number. A tone would signal that a new caller had picked up and I’d start the script, pressing items for responses, such as if I’d gotten the right person (the software had the first name of who I was calling), if they were supporting Kamala Harris or not, etc.

The end goal for this calling session was to see how folks were voting, and to encourage Kamala supporters to volunteer.  Potential volunteers would receive a follow-up call.  I actually had a few who wanted to volunteer and others who said that work/life didn't give them time, although they were voting for Harris.

There were a lot of hang ups, and voice mails, but the only ""angry"" person was actually a Kamala voter who was just sick of getting so many calls.  I feel for folks that live in swing states!

About 10 minutes before the session ended, we joined back on our Zoom call for a debrief.  We also had a short form to fill out about what was front-of-mind for voters (it was inflation on my calls). Some folks had questions and suggestions, but mostly it was positive feedback.

Icy_Statement_2410,Texas AG Ken Paxton Spends 2 Years on Undercover Operation To Find Voter Registration at the Drivers License Office,"Ken Paxton has found that Non-profits have been setting up booths at drivers license offices and handing out voter registration forms. Ken Paxton claims their goal is to register non-citizens, because when you get/renew your license, youre given the option to register to vote, so why do people need another chance? Clearly Ken Paxton has never declined a Windows update. 

If that were it, it would be funny. But no. Because of this ""investigation"", voter registration booths are no longer allowed at Texas DPS. So, kinda seems like Paxton wants to prevent people who initially declined to register to vote, not non-citizens who can't vote anyways. Seeing as how his 2 year ""undercover operation"" didn't turn up actual evidence of non-citizens trying to vote, but theyre kicking out all voter registration groups.",13,0.82,4,1724348954,Liberal

I don't trust the supreme court. Can't Biden just remove them with his power if that happens? Can't Biden refuse to leave? Or what if he stepped down and let Harris be president so she can use her supreme court given authority to stop it?

The sc did it with Bush V Gore, but gore willingly stepped down, I pray Harris doesn't make the same mistake. I know we want to be the party of order, but at the same time we can't let them cheat.

meta_microbe_main,What kind of prosecutor was Kamala Harris? Setting the facts straight,"I've seen in a lot of comments, and heard from some friends in real life as well, opinions that are very negative about Kamala's experience as a district attorney and then attorney general. Basically anyone claiming ""Kamala was a cop"".

Looking into this, I did a lot of research and wanted to share just some of the things I found. First, I think it's important to acknowledge that being a prosecutor is a tough job, one that deals with tough moral situations, especially as part of a social justice system that is often biased and unfair. I doubt there's a prosecutor in the country who I agree with as a liberal on every decision. But despite this, prosecutors obviously serve a crucially important role in any legal system. And it is really simply incorrect to claim that Kamala was just ""a cop"", or inherently or entirely illiberal in her legal record.

  
1. Harris had a liberal record for the time on marijuana prosecution. While DA of San Francisco, her office's policy [was to not seek jail time for mere possession](https://www.marijuanamoment.net/trump-claims-harris-jailed-thousands-and-thousands-of-black-people-over-marijuana-but-her-actual-record-as-a-prosecutor-is-more-nuanced/). Only a handful of people were jailed for possession under her tenure, most probably for extenuated issues. 

Of course, since then the Biden-Harris administration [reclassified marijuana](https://www.npr.org/2024/04/30/1248205659/marijuana-reclassify-biden-less-restrictions) and she's the first mainstream [presidential candidate to be pro-legalization](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dariosabaghi/2024/07/22/where-does-kamala-harris-stand-on-marijuana/).

2. One of Harris' biggest initatives as DA was ""Back on Track"", which provided housing, job training, and substance abuse treatment for nonviolent offenders charged with drug possession. [The program was really successful](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/voices/2020/08/10/kamala-harris-progressive-pioneer-san-francisco-da-column/3334668001/), greatly reducing the rate of re-offenses, and [saved tax payers money](https://bja.ojp.gov/sites/g/files/xyckuh186/files/Publications/BackonTrackFS.pdf). In the end, it was so successful that other cities around the country like [Baltimore](https://www.baltimoresun.com/2015/05/14/mosby-new-program-gives-nonviolent-offenders-a-second-chance/) and Philly copied it as well.

3. She's always been consistently against the [death penalty](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/466546-harris-campaign-releases-ad-on-opposition-to-death-penalty/). As [written in 2004](https://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/New-D-A-promises-to-be-smart-on-crime-Harris-2831205.php) when she was elected to SF DA: ""Harris has pledged to continue Hallinan's practice of supporting patients receiving medical marijuana, refusing to seek the death penalty and prosecuting three-strike offenders only for serious or violent felonies."" 

""It takes much more than building prisons and locking away prisoners to keep our city safe,"" Harris said.

4. As AG, she created a [new division and initiative](https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-kamala-d-harris-launches-initiative-reduce-recidivism) to help first time offenders reintegrate in society and avoid repeat crimes. She also [refused to enforce Prop 8](https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/harris-vows-to-abandon-prop-8/1860319/), the ban on gay marriage on California eventually declared unconstitutional. 

For more, see: [Public defender: I worked with Kamala Harris. She was the most progressive DA in California](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/voices/2020/08/10/kamala-harris-progressive-pioneer-san-francisco-da-column/3334668001/).

**Now, who did Harris really prosecute hard? Large corporations, polluters, and banks.**

5. She [fought for big banks to pay $20 billlion to California home owners during the 2008-2009 financial crisis, and won](https://fortune.com/2024/07/22/kamala-harris-jamie-dimon-settlement-california-homeowners-big-banks-financial-crisis/).

6. She also won a $1.1 billion settlement [from a predatory for-profit school](https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-kamala-d-harris-obtains-11-billion-judgment-against-predatory): “For years, Corinthian profited off the backs of poor people – now they have to pay. This judgment sends a clear message: there is a cost to this kind of predatory conduct,” said Attorney General Harris. “My office will continue to do everything in our power to help these vulnerable students obtain all available relief, as they work to achieve their academic and professional goals.”

6. She pushed for the [passage of the Homeowner's Bill of Rights in California](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/calif-attorney-general-kamala-harris-fights-for-struggling-homeowners/), and won [hundreds of millions](https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-suntrust-mortgage-settlement-20140618-story.html) back for homeowners from banks for multiple abuses.

7. She recovered [hundreds of millions](https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/california-to-receive-hundreds-of-millions-in-bank-of-america-settlement-mortgage-kamala-harris-department-of-justice/) for state pensions from Bank of America who mismanaged their investments in 2009. 

8. She won $[241 million from ](https://www.latimes.com/business/la-xpm-2011-may-20-la-fi-quest-settlement-20110520-story.html)a company overcharging Medi-Cal, and [$323 million from another](https://legalnewsline.com/stories/510527871-harris-323m-scan-settlement-record-recovery-for-calif-program). 

9. She held [shipping companies behind an oil spill](https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/44-million-settles-Cosco-Busan-oil-spill-in-bay-2308869.php) responsible for $44 million for environmental clean-up, [fined a company behind a pipeline](https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-santa-barbara-county-oil-spill-20160517-snap-story.html) spill in Santa Barbara, and [fined BP and Arco $14 million for unsafe oil storage](https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/BP-Arco-to-pay-14-million-in-suit-over-gas-10621426.php) practices.

rayvenLunatic,"Am I party blind or is it healthy suspicion when someone claims to be a lib, but isn’t voting for KH?","When I interact with people that claimed to be liberal or democrat, but heavily oppose VP Kamala Harris I become very suspicious of their political beliefs/views. So here is why. 

I almost never start off a political discussion with my party affiliation. I live in a swing state and since the beginning of time it had always been red. Telling someone I am a Dem/Lib is a good way to shoot my own-self in the foot! As we approach the presidential election it’s a popular topic of conversation. It’s one I avoid whenever possible. However, I’ve notice lately an increase in people saying “I’m democrat/liberal/progressive, and I’m not voting for her.” Again where I live, you don’t tell people your affiliation. You just start shit talking the other candidate or put a bumper sticker on your car and bitch about gas prices! IMO Kamala Harris is no brainer. So, am I party blind? Or are Dems/liberals suddenly coming out of the closet. Seeing something about KH I’m not? I just don’t put anything past MAGA. I could see them party switching to pull a vote from KH!

Bright-Tops5691,Harris VP Shortlist-Pros and Cons,"Sorry, not sure if this is against the rules of the Subreddit (really sorry if it is), but I thought it would be fun to make a pros and cons list for each of the three candidates who appear to be in the VP shortlist: Andy Beshear, Pete Buttigieg, Mark Kelly, Josh Shapiro and Tim Walz.

 I'm not going to give my own opinion, and this list is not necessarily representative about my own opinion. 

Likewise, if I list a position a candidate has taken as a con, that is not a criticism of that position, just a reflection over how I believe it could play in November.


Andy Beshear

Pros:
-Young
-Proven track record of winning in a red state, on issues important to the Democratic base such as abortion and protecting trans youth
-Seen as highly competent, dealt natural disasters/emergencies well
-Can attack Vance
-Appeals to blue-collar voters
-Strong with labor unions but not seen as too progressive to turn off swing voters
-Record of bipartisanship
-Very popular in Kentucky
-Connects well with voters
-Is a governor, could bring a different type of experience to the ticket

Cons:
-Republicans will bash him as having been born with a ""silver spoon"" in his mouth, could open ticket to ""Democratic elite"" attacks
-Kentucky isn't in play
-Concerns among some groups over record on abortion


Pete Buttigieg

Pros:
-Young
-Talented attack dog
-Strong communicator
-Could have good chemistry with Harris-their husbands are friends.
-Strong fundraiser
-Would invigorate the base
-From Midwest, his husband is from Michigan
-Inspiring story
-Connects well with voters
-Served in Afghanistan
-Helped implement much of the Build Back Better Plan

Cons:
-Will be criticised over response to East Palestine train derailment
-Could turn off swing voters
-Served with Harris in Biden administration, an administration that is, unfortunately (and I would argue unjustly) unpopular
-Will be blamed for air travel delays.
-Has not served in statewide or federal elected office



Mark Kelly

Pros:
-From a swing state
-Proven track record of winning in a swing state (including in a year where the environment was hostile to Democrats)
-Inspiring personal story
-Was an astronaut/Navy Captain
-Blunts attacks on Harris over immigration
-Gun control advocacy could invigorate the base
-Is seen as knowledgeable and is well-regarded by colleagues
-Considered a pragmatist, won't turn off centrists
-Attuned to local issues in Arizona, such as water conservation 

Cons: 
-Not from the Midwest
-Arizona borders California, so he doesn't really add much geographic diversity to the ticket
-Didn't cosponsor PRO Act-could hurt campaign's standing with unions and progressives
-Concerns about his strength as a speaker and ability to connect with voters
-Democrats could struggle to hold his Senate seat in a special election


Josh Shapiro

Pros:
-From Pennsylvania, the biggest swing state
-Has a track record of running ahead of other Democratic candidates in Pennsylvania
-Investigated child sexual abuse within the Catholic Church
-Is seen as a competent governor 
-Received praise from across the political spectrum for his response to the Interstate 95 Collapse
-As a governor, could bring a different type of experience to the ticket
-Is a brilliant speaker
-Strong fundraiser

Cons:
-Support for school-choice could hurt campaign with unions and progressives
-Staunch support for Israel could turn off progressives and Arabs, and could jeopardise the campaign in Michigan, which has a sizable Arab population


Tim Walz

Pros:
-Is from the Midwest
-Can connect with rural voters
-Repeatedly won in a conservative congressional district
-Used to be a Sergeant
-Was a high school geography teacher and football coach, and served as faculty advisor to the school's GSA
-Popular with progressives, would invigorate the base
-Has a record of achievement in Minnesota having passed laws protecting the right to choose and enacting free school meals for students
-Unexpectedly an attack dog-came up with the ""weird"" attack line
-Folksy, says it like it is, can connect with voters
-Popular with unions
-Is a governor, so could bring a different type of experience to the ticket
-Out of all contenders, has the most political experience

Cons:
-Is seen as the most progressive candidate under consideration, could turn off swing voters
-Possibly the least known of all contenders on the shortlist
-Is seen by some as a bit gruff
-In the nicest way possible, doesn't exactly radiate youth (although he's actually only six months older than Harris)
-Out of all contenders, has been in politics the longest time",1,1,3,1722428292,Liberal

To some, it sounded more like what Kremlin would propose.  Is it looking likely that the U.S. is going to abandon Ukraine, or this is just a part of forcing the war to come to an end?

mrcsrnne,Did Globalization Just Make the Free Market Too Efficient for Its Own Good?,"Ah, globalization! That grand economic experiment where we were told that free markets would lift all boats, make us all richer, and turn the world into one big happy trading family. At first, it worked. Trade flourished, economies grew, and capitalists popped champagne. But here’s where things get tricky.

What tends to happen next is less of a fairy tale and more of a thriller. Once firms grow large enough to wield the magic wand of global supply chains, they begin an efficiency quest. Labour, once a stable and locally anchored force, becomes a game of arbitrage—moving from high-wage economies to lower-cost regions. At first, this boosts corporate profits and consumer purchasing power (who doesn’t love cheap gadgets?). But soon enough, it triggers a paradox: the same workers who benefited from cheaper goods suddenly find themselves out of a job because their own wages are now “too expensive” compared to, say, a factory in Vietnam or a call center in the Philippines.

This isn’t a novel observation. Dani Rodrik, in *The Globalization Paradox*, argues that nations must choose two out of three: **democracy, national sovereignty, and hyper-globalization**—but never all three at once. When companies chase cheap labour worldwide, it weakens the social contract at home, destabilizing domestic politics. Karl Polanyi, way back in *The Great Transformation*, predicted that unregulated markets would eventually provoke a political backlash. Sound familiar?

As globalization speeds up, firms consolidate. Economies of scale mean that once an industry starts outsourcing, the biggest players outgrow competition at an alarming rate. What we’re left with isn’t the efficient free market of Adam Smith’s dreams, but rather a handful of corporate behemoths who shape industries, dictate wages, and set the rules. It’s not capitalism eating itself—it’s capitalism evolving into oligopoly.

And here’s where things get dark. Economic distress fuels political instability. Laid-off workers, unable to transition fast enough to new jobs, don’t stay quietly unemployed. They get angry. They vote. And not for centrists promising nuanced economic policy—no, they turn to populists, strongmen, and “disruptors” who promise to break the system that failed them. Protectionism rises, economic nationalism takes over, and before you know it, the world is no longer discussing trade deals but trade wars. Worse still, history suggests economic dislocation is one of the key ingredients for actual wars (see: the 1930s).

So here’s my question to you, fellow Redditors and armchair economists: **Is there a way for economics to self-correct before it spirals into geopolitical disaster? Can we design policies that maintain competitive markets while preventing the economic distortions that lead to instability and war?**

Would love to hear your thoughts—before the next financial crisis or world conflict proves the theory right.",13,0.71,25,1739268433,PoliticalDiscussion
thatdamnorange,Can Ukraine win?,"Hello everyone,  
During the elections in Germany, I tried to find out about the current situation in Ukraine. My problem is that I have not yet found a trustworthy source that analyzes whether Ukraine is even capable of winning the war with the troops it has available. If this is the case, I have not yet been able to find any information about how many billions of $/€ in military aid would be necessary to achieve this goal.  
  
Important: (Winning is defined here as: completely recapturing the territory conquered by Russia)  
  
  
So here are my questions:  
  
1. Can Ukraine win the war with the current number of soldiers?  
  
2. How much military aid in $/€ must be invested to achieve this type of victory?  
  
3. How many soldiers would likely lose their lives as a result?  
  
  
I am aware that the war could easily be ended through intervention in the form of NATO operations (even if this also raises the question of costs and human lives and hardly any NATO country is currently in favor of this). Since this is not the question asked here, I would ask you to ignore this possibility.  
  
Furthermore, if figures and facts are mentioned, I would ask you to verify them with links to sources.  
  
Thanks

CelestialFury,Do you believe that Trump will try for a third term?,"[Trump declines to endorse Vance as 2028 successor](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-declines-endorse-jd-vance-2028-successor-2029106), which lead me to think how he would run for a third term and he has spoke about it before.  

The [Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-second_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) states that:

&gt;Section 1. No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once. But this Article shall not apply to any person holding the office of President when this Article was proposed by the Congress, and shall not prevent any person who may be holding the office of President, or acting as President, during the term within which this Article becomes operative from holding the office of President or acting as President during the remainder of such term.

&gt;Section 2. This Article shall be inoperative unless it shall have been ratified as an amendment to the Constitution by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several states within seven years from the date of its submission to the states by the Congress.

Then the [Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelfth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) states:

&gt;But no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice-President of the United States.

It seems rather clear that a President cannot *run* for POTUS after two terms and they are not eligible for being vice president.  I think this sets three scenarios for Trump becoming President a third time.  

**Option 1:** He still runs as President a third time and this may be considered an ""official act.""  Yes, it's technically against the US Constitution, Amendment 22, but who would be able to stop him if he's legally protected? 

**Option 2:** Trump runs for Speaker of the House in 2028, supporting the two others for President and Vice President on the Republican ticket.  They resign after being sworn in and Trump becomes President again.

**Option 3:**  The SCOTUS could look into the ratification since you need 75% of states to agree to the amendment.  We could see that some states ""pull"" their submissions, enough to put it under the threshold or challenge the legality of the original submission.  The SCOTUS takes the case and makes it legal for them to pull their requests, the amendment gets dissolved.  

Which option do you think Trump would take?  Are there any more possibilities that Trump could try for a third term?",515,0.85,537,1739256098,PoliticalDiscussion
Awesomeuser90,Veto referendums are a way to have electors decide on the fate of laws. Are they a good idea in your mind?,"Basically, imagine that a new bill has been made into law. Some people are furious and so they get enough signatories to demand a referendum be held on the bill. If the voters approve of the bill, it remains a law, if they don't, it is repealed. Different places have different rules on whether or not the law is provisionally valid pending the vote or not, and how many signatories it takes and how long they have to collect them, in the 23 American states with them it varies from 1.5% in Massachusetts to 15% of the ballots in the last election, and usually 90 days to collect signatures from the end of the session. Switzerland is a prolific user of this mechanism, and in Switzerland, there is no such thing as a court finding a law unconstitutional, the people alone decide whether or not to uphold a law or not.

It could also be incorporated into the way it combines with an executive veto. Iceland's president's veto over bills takes the form of referring the bill to the population to vote on whether or not to sustain the bill. This has been used a couple of times, notably in the Icelandic debt crisis where voters were referred a bill on a restructuring plan and was massively defeated with 98% of the voters opposing the bill with 62% turnout. In Argentina, if the president vetoes a bill, and the congress can't get 2/3 support in both houses to override but can get majority support, the bill goes to a referendum for judgement.

Visco0825,Is the current potential constitutional crisis important to average voters?,"We are three weeks into the Trump administration and there are already claims of potential constitutional crises on the horizon.  The first has been the Trump administration essentially impounding congressional approved funds.  While the executive branch gets some amount of discretion, the legislative branch is primarily the one who picks and chooses who and what money is spent on.  The second has been the Trump administration  dissolving and threatening to elimination various agencies.  These include USAID, DoEd, and CFPB, among others.  These agencies are codified by law by Congress.  The third, and the actual constitutional crisis, is the trump administrations defiance of the courts.  Discussion of disregarding court orders originally started with Bannon.  This idea has recently been vocalized by both Vance and Musk.  Today a judge has reasserted his court order for Trump to release funds, which this administration currently has not been following.

The first question, does any of this matter? Sure, this will clearly not poll well but is it actual salient or important to voters?  Average voters have shown to have both a large tolerance of trumps breaking of laws and norms and a very poor view of our current system.  Voters voted for Trump despite the explicit claims that Trump will put the constitution of this country at risk.  They either don’t believe trump is actually a threat or believe that the guardrails will always hold.  But Americans love America and a constitutional crisis hits at the core of our politics.  Will voters only care if it affects them personally?  Will Trump be rewarded for breaking barriers to achieve the goals that he says voters sent him to the White House to achieve?

Alert-Algae-6674,How will the increasing diversity in the Republican voter base impact its future?,"Trump's voter base in 2024 was more diverse than many people expected, with many key groups like Black Americans, Latinos, Asians, and Jews shifting to the right politically. College educated people and young men have also shifted to the right. They didn’t all go for Trump overall but they still shifted to the right compared to previous years. 

Cities and their suburbs, traditionally Democratic strongholds, have begun voting more Republican too. This could be important as rural America is shrinking quickly and more people are flocking to urban and suburban areas. By 2050, 89% of the American population is projected to live in urban/suburban areas, up from 83% right now. I think these are things that could shape what the Republican Party becomes in the future and what their priorities are.

The archetype of a Republican voter has traditionally been an older white person from a rural area. But as time goes on, this could change.

We don’t know if these changes are only for 2024 or if it’s a broader trend that will be more permanent. Since these groups may become a bigger part of the Republican electorate, how do you think this will affect the future of conservative politics in the United States if it kept going this direction? Would this curb the influence of far right extremist groups like White nationalists?

Also, despite the increased racial diversity, two groups that shifted further away from Republicans were women and the LGBTQ community, so it will be interesting to see how that develops. I wonder if the divide will shift from race to more about sexuality

Cidodino,Why do white supremacists have so much freedom in the United States?,"In the United States, the First Amendment to the Constitution protects free speech almost absolutely, allowing white supremacist groups, neo-Nazis and other far-right organizations to demonstrate publicly without government intervention, as long as they do not directly incite violence. Why has this legal protection allowed events such as the Right-wing Unity March in Charlottesville in 2017, where neo-Nazis and white nationalists paraded with torches chanting slogans such as 'Jews will not replace us,' to take place without prior restrictions? How is it possible that in multiple U.S. cities, demonstrations by groups like the Ku Klux Klan or the neo-Nazi militia Patriot Front are allowed, while in countries like Germany, where Nazism had its origins, hate speech, including the swastika and the Nazi salute, has been banned?

Throughout history, the U.S. has protected these expressions even when they generate social tension and violence, as happened in the 1970s with the Nazi Party of America case in Skokie, Illinois, where the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the right of neo-Nazis to march in a community of Holocaust survivors. Why does U.S. law not prevent the display of symbols such as the swastika, the Confederate flag, or the Nazi-inspired 'Sonnenrad' (sun wheel), despite being linked to hate crimes? What role do factors such as lobbying by far-right groups, the influence of political sectors that minimize the problem of white supremacism, and inconsistent enforcement of hate crime laws play in this permissiveness?

In addition, FBI ([2022](https://www.justice.gov/hatecrimes/hate-crime-statistics-2022)) ([2023](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-violent-crime-decreased-2023-hate-crimes-rose-fbi-reports-2024-09-23/)) studies have pointed to an increase in white supremacist group activity and an increase in hate crimes in recent years. Why, despite intelligence agencies warning that right-wing extremism represents one of the main threats of domestic terrorism, do these groups continue to operate with relative impunity? What responsibility do digital platforms have in spreading supremacist ideologies and radicalizing new members? To what extent does the First Amendment protect speech that advocates racial discrimination and violence, and where should the line be drawn between free speech and hate speech?

I ask all this with respect, with no intention to offend or attack any society. The question is based on news that have reached me and different people around the world. Here are some of these news items:

Visco0825,How can democrats attack anti-DEI/promote DEI without resulting in strong political backlash?,"In recent politics there have been two major political pushes for diversity and equality.  However, both instances led to backlashes that have led to an environment that is arguably worse than it was before.  In 2008 Obama was the first black president one a massive wave of hope for racial equality and societal reforms.  This led to one of the largest political backlashes in modern politics in 2010, to which  democrats have yet to fully recover from.  This eventually led to birtherism which planted some of the original seeds of both Trump and MAGA. The second massive political push promoting diversity and equality was in 2018 with the modern woman election and 2020 with racial equality being a top priority.  Biden made diversifying the government a top priority.  This led to an extreme backlash among both culture and politics with anti-woke and anti-DEI efforts.  This resent contributed to Trump retaking the presidency.  Now Trump is pushing to remove all mentions of DEI in both the private and public sectors.  He is hiding all instances that highlight any racial or gender successes.  His administration is pushing culture to return to a world prior to the civil rights era.  

This leads me to my question.  Will there be a backlash for this?  How will it occur?  How can democrats lead and take advantage of the backlash while trying to mitigate a backlash to their own movement?  It seems as though every attempt has led to a stronger and more severe response.

We have seen immense misinformation and conspiracy. It's to the point that there are two world views to literally everything that happens. Somehow, objectivity has been pushed to the side. I won't even talk about the most basic news events with anyone but close friends and family for fear that somehow it will be politicized. The conspiratorial thinking has been injected into everything. It's as if certain groups live in entirely different worlds.

 But can we be reeled back from all this? It only seems to be accelerating. I am trying to be optimistic. I want to see a path forward for regular discourse and objective truth. I am finding it very hard to see the light.

Has this ever been experienced in the past? On such a large scale? History repeats itself. So what has happened? The internet and connectivity and manipulation of our minds seems a bit unprecedented. But maybe there's a path out of this that has been paved before.

Alone-Sky-2086,The 'Russian Tail' in Election Data: A Red Flag or a Bigger Threat?,"
I recently came across a video explaining something called the 'Russian tail' in election data analysis, and it got me thinking—how often does this pattern appear in elections worldwide? If it's been documented in contested elections before, could it be a sign of deeper systemic issues? And more importantly, could similar anomalies have influenced past U.S. elections—or even shape future ones?

A Russian tail is a statistical anomaly often observed in elections with suspected fraud. Normally, vote distributions follow a smooth bell curve, but in some cases, an extra spike appears—suggesting that votes may have been shifted in specific precincts. This pattern has been documented in Russian elections, Georgia elections and and some watchdog groups claim to have seen similar anomalies in Romania most recently. There were independent journalists and analysts that reported they noticed the same anomalies in the November 2024 U.S election.

With all the concerns about election integrity and foreign interference—especially disinformation campaigns aimed at making people distrust results—do you think statistical anomalies like this could impact public confidence in the U.S. electoral process? Even if fraud isn’t proven, does simply showing these data patterns create enough doubt to destabilize democracy?

Curious to hear what others think! Have you seen any credible research on this in U.S. elections? Could this be a real issue, or is it just another layer of political chaos?

tardiscoder,Is Elon Musk’s Expanding Government Influence a Threat to Democracy?,"Over the past few weeks, Elon Musk and his team at the **Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)** have taken actions that some argue resemble historical authoritarian power grabs. Reports indicate that Musk’s team has **gained access to Treasury payment systems** and has begun dismantling agencies like **USAID without congressional approval**. The ability of a private citizen to consolidate power in this way raises serious concerns about **democratic oversight, separation of powers, and national security risks**.

Historically, authoritarian figures have used legal mechanisms to **sidestep traditional checks and balances**, and critics argue that we’re seeing a similar pattern here. However, others believe that **government agencies have become bloated and inefficient**, and Musk’s involvement may be necessary to “streamline” operations.

How do you see this situation playing out? **Is Musk’s role a dangerous overreach, or is it a justified move toward government efficiency?** What safeguards should be in place to prevent **unelected individuals from gaining unchecked control over government operations?**

TaylorSwiftian,How is Musk's DOGE team in 2025 different from Obama's young staffers in 2009?,"In recent weeks since Trump came back into the presidency, much of the political commentary, especially angst on the part of the left, is directed toward Elon Musk's DOGE team of young engineers accessing various governmental agencies with the approval of Trump. The goal is supposedly to root out inefficiencies and eliminated programs and policies that are contrary to Trump's executive orders. A lot of the attention has been focused on how young and inexperienced these techies are and how they might not understand what they are doing to the inner workings of the departments they are reviewing.

Back in 2009, after Barack Obama came into office, a much different media environment existed where the flock of young staffers, policy gurus and even techies from what was then a mostly Democratic Silicon Valley, were praised and given supportive backing by many of the same journalist outlets. The profiles were largely about how these eager college grads would transform government and bring it into the 21st century while also repudiating anything under the then despised outgoing president George W. Bush.

Why do you think the attention on the young cohort of government whiz kids is so different from today under Trump than it was under Obama? Is it just partisan bias?

PsychLegalMind,Trump's position on how to resolve the Ukrainian conflict continues to fluctuate ranging from bringing the war to an immediate halt to further escalation. Is Trump more likely to escalate the war with more support for Ukraine?,"Trump has also talked about a pause in the war as negotiations are initiated and eventual resolution. He has spoken of rare earth minerals from Ukraine for continued support, \[except most of that land is presently occupied by the Russians.\]  

Many think that it is possible Trump would be willing to resolve the conflict for concession of land by the Ukrainians. This option may not be acceptable to Ukraine, however, unless they get something significant in return.   

Nonetheless, unlike Biden Trump is open to talks with Putin and has promised to do so. Putin recently noted in an interview that he is open to talks with Trump.

“We always had a business-like, pragmatic but also trusting relationship with the current U.S. president,” Putin said. “I couldn’t disagree with him that if he had been president, if they hadn’t stolen victory from him in 2020, the crisis that emerged in Ukraine in 2022 could have been avoided.”

Is Trump more likely to escalate the war with more support for Ukraine?

Moreover, many progressives have voiced a call to action to save USAID. However, such actions may be moot given that the Republicans will likely use the reconciliation bill that doesn't require any Democratic votes to defund USAID as well as enacting the GOP's other priorities such as tax cuts.

One aspect of this question is the tariffs and apparent trade war; Canada had previously been evaluating the SAAB Gripen as well, so there is an industry-respected alternative.

Another aspect of this is reliability in the event of actual conflict between the two nations, which previously seemed impossible to contemplate. This calls to mind the intelligence information that France provides the UK during the Falklands War on means to defeat the Exocet anti-ship missile that France had previously sold to Argentina, and also that France had a kill switch that they reportedly did not share with UK. 

Does Canada want to buy $14B of national defense technology from a nation that is an unreliable partner at best, with whom you now have a trade war, has made statements that intimate future aggression, and who could disable the technology in a conflict?

The big problem that is frequently discussed is [ageing of Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing_of_Europe), which refers to increasing number of old people, who consume a lot of resources both in healthcare system and pensions, whilst the increase in tax payer population cannot keep the pace, leading to increased taxations with all the associated negatives for the economy.

So my question is: what can be done? We can increase retirement age (I've seen ideas of canceling pensions completely), introduce migrants as taxpayers (this is causing a lot of arguments and fuels conservative parties), or just kind of wait for 50 years to ""ride the wave"" of changing demographics, which to me seems rather ineffective.

3. That shutting down trade with Canada will kill the country and allow it to be annexed

DecentForever343,"Public Health, Body Positivity, and Political Scrutiny—Where Should the Line Be Drawn?","With RFK Jr.’s nomination for Secretary of Health and Human Services sparking intense debate, it raises broader questions about how public health officials are judged—and whether scrutiny is applied consistently.

Under Xavier Becerra and Dr. Rachel Levine, obesity rates continued to rise, particularly among children. Despite obesity being one of the leading contributors to chronic disease, no major policy shifts were implemented to combat the dominance of ultra-processed foods or improve national dietary standards. Meanwhile, some argue that the approach to obesity has shifted toward body positivity and weight inclusivity rather than stricter public health interventions like dietary regulations, calorie control, or exercise-focused initiatives. Others believe that body positivity is an important movement that helps reduce stigma and improve mental health outcomes.

At the same time, Levine’s nomination was largely framed in terms of representation, as she became the first openly transgender federal official confirmed by the Senate. Critics argue that this emphasis on identity shielded her from scrutiny over her policies or personal health, while others see it as an important milestone in diversity and inclusion. Meanwhile, RFK Jr. is facing an aggressive confirmation process, largely due to his views on vaccines and alternative health approaches. This raises a question: does political or social alignment influence how much scrutiny a public health official receives?

Keeper_Tax,Income Tax Repeal: Is the Fair Tax Act feasible?,"There's is momentum in a *slightly*\-theoretical but still tangible movement to repeal the income tax. I'm sure many of you are familiar with the [Fair Tax Act](https://buddycarter.house.gov/uploadedfiles/118h25.pdf), the premise is around abolishing the IRS, and introducing consumption tax (in effect, removing other forms of taxes such as income, estate, etc).

There's a pretty interesting read by John Cochrane on advocacy for this that I remember reading last year: [https://www.chicagobooth.edu/review/its-time-us-abolished-income-tax](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/review/its-time-us-abolished-income-tax) and a more thorough read on pros and cons by Bankman &amp; Fried, at Stanford [https://law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/default/files/publication/257986/doc/slspublic/86GeoLJ539.pdf](https://law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/default/files/publication/257986/doc/slspublic/86GeoLJ539.pdf) (yup, that's SBF's dad 😂)

Thought I'd open up a discussion right before everyone heads to the weekend -

* How do you feel about this prospective change? For context, other economists do argue that the Fair Tax act is insufficient, and the actual consumption tax rate will need to be much higher to keep everything running
* In the backdrop of this is the idea that our current tax code is actually too complicated/byzantine. Do you agree (if you file US taxes)?
* Impact on the tax + accounting industry in whole - mainly, how real this proposal where we might actually see serious consideration on people's careers? If you're an accountant or work in taxes - how do you feel?

damndirtyape,"In general, what is the Democratic position on Edward Snowden and mass surveillance programs?","Edward Snowden has been in the news recently. The Senate Intelligence Committee is conducting hearings to review the nomination of Tulsi Gabbard to be the Director of National Intelligence. In these hearings, there have been some intense exchanges regarding Edward Snowden. 

Gabbard acknowledged that Snowden's actions were illegal, and she committed to preventing any such leaks in the future. However, she declined to call him a traitor after multiple Democratic senators demanded that she do so. Some Democratic senators seemed to feel that her sympathy for Snowden should disqualify her for the role. 

In light of these hearings, it leads one to wonder, what are the Democratic views towards Edward Snowden and the mass surveillance program that he revealed? Is there widespread agreement among Democrats that Snowden is a traitor? Does the Democratic Party broadly support the surveillance programs? 

Edward Snowden says that he was inspired to leak the information after watching James Clapper deny the existence of these surveillance programs. How do Democrats feel about previous attempts to hide the existence of these programs? 

The Democratic members of the Senate Intelligence Committee seemed to have strong negative feelings towards Snowden. Is this a bias of the Senate Intelligence Committee? Or, is this a feeling that Democrats hold generally? 

What is the Democratic position on mass surveillance programs? Is this view consistent with their views in previous decades? Or, have the views of the party changed from what they were during the George W. Bush administration?",131,0.84,387,1738331093,PoliticalDiscussion
Awesomeuser90,How best do you think governance can take advantage of citizens assemblies?,"Athens is known for being a progenitor of democracy, but Athens did not elect most of its officials. The main ones who were would have been the strategoi, generals. Note that those who were voting were also its civil militia and they would have been soldiers too who knew what battle was like. The Boule had hundreds of members chosen by lot (having been elected in big batches, drawing some of those elected to the Boule) and this functioned as the governing senate of Athens. Juries of 201, 501, 1001, and 1501 people were also common, with the presiding magistrate also chosen by lot. They viewed elections as a risky way to govern a polity given that people could be bribed or intimidated to vote a certain way or otherwise to elect people who were risky people, but nobody could bribe the gods to choose one person over another in the drawing of lots, and an assembly of hundreds of people with time and ability to deliberate and seek information could make decisions likely to be representative of the whole people and not concerned over the short term political wish to be reelected or to otherwise climb in power.

In the modern era, we have juries, with jurors who are biased struck from the pool before the trial commences, but that isn't the only opportunity to use random chance. Some countries have turned to the idea of lottery to choose a large panel of people to deliberate on issues where it is seen that politicians might not be so good at, especially issues related to the rules of how politicians get put in office in the first place. In British Columbia, 19 years ago, a citizens assembly recommended a voting reform that was put to referendum and agreed to by 57% of voters, but the threshold had been set at 60% which was widely denounced as unconstitutional and illegitimate given that no such threshold was used to put the current system of voting into place and so why could it be legitimate to need 60% to change it? 

Ireland used a citizens assembly to consider several issues, pertaining to whether snap elections can happen and if so how, how climate change reactions could occur, abortion laws, how pensions could be dealt with, and a few other things. They did divide over a few issues, but many votes actually had quite strong consensus. For months, they listened to people who presented their views, including experts, members of the public, affected people, members of the government, etc. 

In principle, a citizens assembly could be given the power to compel information too from witnesses and to compel evidence too, or to demand a government official testify under oath on pain of perjury for lying or misleading them. Maybe they could do a budget analysis and plan and suggest that to the legislature or executive. They rarely have the power to make a binding decision of policy, but they may have their recommendation referred to a legislature or executive or the people for ratification. Maybe they could even be a third house of a legislature, even if it is more advisory or its decisions need approval by the people or the other houses to become policy or law.

HolcroftA,Is American voter turnout permanently higher since the Trump era?,"The 2016 election was a lull in terms of turnout but ever since then the two elections since have had the two highest voter turnout of the last 6 decades.

In 2020 the turnout rates were very similar and by 2024 American turnout was actually quite a bit higher than British turnout for the first time in recent history.

Peters is 66 and led the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee for the last two cycles, so his retirement was unexpected. Coming on the tail of a Trump victory in Michigan, this means we'll have yet another nominal battleground Senate race next year on top of Jon Ossoff's bid for reelection in Georgia. Peters was first elected in 2014 in a landslide, right in the middle of a massive Republican wave. He was reelected in 2020 by a little more than a point and a half, defeating now-Rep. John James, who was considered one of the best GOP recruits that cycle. Notably, this was half of Biden's 3-point margin in the state that year. 

Democrats have a very deep bench in Michigan, and with [Gov. Gretchen Whitmer](https://www.wxyz.com/news/whitmer-wont-run-for-open-u-s-senate-seat-but-buttigieg-reportedly-considering-it) ruling out a bid, and [Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson running for Governor](https://apnews.com/article/michigan-secretary-of-state-jocelyn-benson-governor-239c5b50c5f37f61c88e2ae0c37d2d38), the field appears to be wide open.

Mallory McMorrow, and [former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg](https://www.axios.com/2025/01/28/pete-buttigieg-michigan-senate), a recent Michigander who's ""taking a serious look"" at the race.

On the Republican side, the party is once again looking at Rep. James, although it's possible he may run for Governor or seek reelection to his House seat instead. State Senate Minority Leader [Aric Nesbitt has already announced his bid](https://apnews.com/article/michigan-governor-republican-aacf430c69c71d00e85dfe02b8829bbd), and former GOP gubernatorial nominee Tudor Dixon - who lost to Whitmer in a landslide in '22 - is also considering jumping in.

Compare that with Democrats' performance in 2016 and 2012 when they lost this group by 20 both years.\*  
  
This may not seem like a lot, but white voters are a majority of the electorate and disproportionately powerful in the electoral college, so even this small swing, if sustainable, could have very serious ramifications for future elections even if it wasn't enough to save Harris in 2024.  

But is this sustainable?  Or is it a peculiar product of the Trump era that will go away once he's no longer on the ballot?  
  
It seems that it may be worth thinking about who these voters are.  Are these well-off suburban whites who are socially progressive but economically more conservative (""Romney Republicans"") who will ""come home"" to the GOP?  Or is this a more long-term demographic change as more conservative older white voters are replaced by more progressive white voters from younger (but now becoming middle aged) generations?

Taysha812,Do you think we can overcome political bias?,"Partisanship—the strong allegiance to a specific political party or ideology—has been one of the biggest challenges to progress in modern America. By its nature, partisanship often creates an “us vs. them” mentality, where people view opposing ideas not as opportunities for dialogue but as threats to their own beliefs. This mindset hinders collaboration and creates division, making it difficult to address the complex issues our nation faces today.

For a country as diverse and multifaceted as the United States, is it realistic—or even beneficial—to align strictly with one side of the political spectrum? Can we find ways to value compromise and shared goals without abandoning our principles?

In leadership, for example, it’s possible to respect someone’s achievements or policies even if we don’t agree with their rhetoric or personal values. This perspective challenges the idea that political affiliation defines the entirety of someone’s worth as a leader. When we judge based solely on party lines, we may miss opportunities to learn from or work with individuals who could otherwise contribute to progress.

The question then becomes: how do we, as individuals and as a nation, move beyond rigid partisanship? What steps can we take to create a more open-minded and collaborative political environment?

Let’s discuss the impact of partisanship on America’s future and explore potential solutions for building unity in these divided times.",0,0.49,31,1737937724,PoliticalDiscussion
American-Toe-Tickler,Why are birth rates so low?,"It's technically a ""problem"" that birth rates are below replacement level in almost any country that's at least semi-developed. I want to know why exactly birth rates are below replacement level, not necessarily argue whether or not it's a bad thing. 

When I see people argue why the birth rates are so low they often bring up policies thst benefits people with prospects of becoming parents, however this seemingly doesn't actually affect the birth rates at all. An example I'll use are the Nordic countries (which have some of the strongest policies when it comes to aiding people in parenthood) that still have below replacement level birth rates.

Illustrious-Site1101,What Is the Trump Administration Plan for Mass Civil Service Layoffs?,"I read today that Trump signed an executive order granting himself the power to fire civil servants. Previously, these workers were protected to ensure the civil service remained non-partisan. According to the article, this change could allow Trump to fire up to 50,000 federal employees. The article indicated many cuts would be because of a distrust of the departments and various other political reasons. While I’m not saying he will fire that many, I do have many questions about the possible firings. 

	1.	Wouldn’t adding so many people to the unemployment rolls be a significant issue? Has anyone considered the impact on local businesses—shops, restaurants, coffee shops, and other services—that rely on these federal employees as customers? The job losses could extend far beyond the federal workforce as many countries saw during the pandemic shutdowns and work from home.
	2.	What happens to these people when they lose their health insurance and livelihoods? Does the administration have a plan to offset this? Does the US have an unemployment insurance program?
	3.	Who will perform these jobs and deliver the services that Americans rely on? Will everything grind to a halt? Or will these be positions that are really unnecessary?
	4.	if these cuts are truly political will cutting these services hurt Trump’s supporters as well? Wouldn’t they be negatively affected by reduced government assistance or fewer public services?
	5.	Are there any plans to help these displaced employees find new jobs? Will the economy be able to absorb them.

Maybe stupid questions, but mass cuts based on politics,  seem reckless and a bit heartless to me.

Motherfolk,How did the generation that once created powerful political protest music come to embrace Trump?,"In the 1960s and 1970s, music was a powerful tool for political expression and protest. Songs like Bob Dylan's ""The Times They Are A-Changin'"", Edwin Starr’s ""War"", and The Beatles’ ""Revolution"" became anthems for change, speaking directly to the injustices of the time — civil rights struggles, the Vietnam War, and economic inequality. These songs echoed a collective desire for progress and a better future.

Fast forward to today, and many members of the Baby Boomer generation—the very ones who helped create this powerful music—are now among the most ardent supporters of Donald Trump. This is especially striking considering how much of the political activism and social consciousness of the 60s and 70s was a direct reaction to authoritarianism, injustice, and the excesses of the elite.
Some examples of iconic political songs from that era:

	•	Bob Dylan – ""The Times They Are A-Changin’"" (1964): This song captured the essence of the 1960s political shift, urging people to embrace change and fight for justice.

	•	Edwin Starr – ""War"" (1970): A powerful anti-Vietnam War anthem that called out the horrors of conflict and questioned the motives behind it.

	•	The Beatles – ""Revolution"" (1968): A song that challenged the status quo and called for a revolutionary change, reflective of the broader counterculture movements of the time.

	•	Buffalo Springfield – ""For What It’s Worth""(1966): A protest song addressing the social unrest and growing tension in the country, often interpreted as a critique of government repression.

These songs weren’t just catchy tunes; they were calls to action, social commentary, and even direct criticism of the establishment.
So, here’s the question: How did a generation that pushed for progressive political change through their music end up aligning with a political figure whose rhetoric and policies seem to contrast so starkly with the values of the 60s and 70s?

Is it a case of cultural nostalgia clouding their judgment? A result of shifting political landscapes? Or has there been a fundamental change in values and priorities within this group?

How can the generation that created and embraced these songs now support someone like Trump? Was it the power of the political system or the media that shifted their perspectives, or something deeper? What do you all think?",583,0.91,303,1737924560,PoliticalDiscussion
The_Triten,Can true meritocracy work?,"The question has two parts.

Part A: Is it actually possible?

Is the idea of meritocracy really possible, or is it a utopia only in paper? Note that meritocracy differs significantly from socialism, since socialism/marxism provides equality for everyone, regardless of their wealth or talent. But meritocracy favors talent over wealth. It agrees with socialism on disregard for inherited wealth, but argues people should be given opportunities based on their ""merit"", which is talent, intelligence, or even beauty. I believe the idea is romanticized in many cyberpunk settings, such as Metropolis (1927) and The Matrix (1999); dystopian societies where rich people are rewarded and poor, talented people are discriminated. It criticizes both capitalism and marxism.

Problem 1: Who determines who's worthy and who's not? Government? Corporates? And who chooses them?

Problem 2: What defines ""merit""? What is the standard of being intelligent/talented?

Problem 3: How can we make sure corruption does not happen, and reach true meritocracy?

Problem 4: Should genetic traits such as intelligence, strength, and beauty only be rewarded, or acquired traits such as hard work should be too?

Part B: If it's possible, is it a good thing?

Let's say somehow, we get close to the idea of true meritocracy. But is this a good thing for a society? If you're good in something, you'll be rewarded. But people with average intelligence/capability will have many challenges. Maybe we can work on giving the ""average"" citizen a descent, livable life; but even then, is it moral?

Pros:

\- Talentless rich people are given the same starting point as talented poor people, where the latter can shine.

\- If hard work is rewarded too, then only you decide your fate. There is no excuse for poverty.

\- If done correctly, social injustice rarely happens. Everyone gets what they ""deserve"". Good people live well, average people live averagely, and bad people live badly.

Cons:

\- ""Talentless"" people, whatever defines that, will live harshly. They're humans too.

\- What happens to families' legacies if there is no inheritance?

\- The society needs constant monitoring and control, where corruption can happen easily.",2,0.54,42,1737808759,PoliticalDiscussion

Awesomeuser90,"With regards to cabinet selections, how useful do you think is Senatorial consent? Can it be improved?","People usually bring up judges when they think of issues with senatorial consent but 1200 people need to be confirmed by the Senate. The most important besides judges would be the cabinet members. It can be useful to avoid a cascade of appointees and preventing the selection from being arbitrary, at least less arbitrary than it would be without this check, and sacking a secretary for disagreement or sticking to their views on what is legal is harder to pull off because you need a replacement, and a person who is a known sycophant is less likely to be able to be made a secretary in the first place given the potential of senatorial opposition, though not a guarantee either. Theory is the nominator bears responsibility for a good nominee being put forth, the senate is responsible for the rejection of a good candidate, and responsible for approval of a bad one without the ability to force a president to nominate anyone in particular.

As for reforms, I would usually think of some power for the minority to get information and to ask questions but ultimately let the majority vote. I would also think of transferring the power to the House, not Senate. Codification of some steps like a background check and the application submitted could be helpful, as could more disclosure of the process used by the president to choose who to nominate in the first place. Can you think of others?

premeddit,An amendment has been introduced in the House of Representatives to allow President Trump to run for a third term. Could he actually attempt to do this? What would be the legal and political ramifications?,"Since President Trump first came to power in 2016, he has made tongue-in-cheek comments about potentially extending his presidency beyond the current Constitutional limits. These comments go as far back as 2020 when he said that after he won the 2020 election, ""[“And then after that, we’ll go for another four years because they spied on my campaign. We should get a redo of four years](https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/18/politics/donald-trump-third-term-2024/index.html)"". More recently, after winning the 2024 election [he spoke to GOP Congressmen and stated that he would run again in 2028 if they were able to find a legal way to do it](https://thehill.com/homenews/nexstar_media_wire/4991169-trump-said-he-cant-run-in-2028-unless-the-gop-figures-something-out-could-that-happen/).

Several members of the President's inner circle, such as Steve Bannon, [have also advocated for this](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-third-term-2028-steve-bannon-constitution-2001185).

This discussion has finally culminated in a proposal to amend the Constitution, introduced this week by Representative Andy Ogles (R-TN). [The amendment would alter the language of the Constitution so that a president who has not yet served two *consecutive* terms, can continue running for president](https://ogles.house.gov/media/press-releases/rep-ogles-proposes-amending-22nd-amendment-allow-trump-serve-third-term). This would allow Trump to run in 2028 as he had two terms already but they were non-consecutive. Conversely, someone like Clinton, Bush or Obama would not qualify to run again since they served two consecutive terms.

The amendment is largely considered to be an extreme long shot that has no chance of winning support from Republicans, let alone Democrats, and will likely die in the House. However, the increasing rhetoric around a possible third term leads to the question of whether President Trump would or could try explore options to stay in office from 2028 onwards. What avenues are available for him to do this? If he does, what political response would he receive from the federal bureaucracy, the military, fellow Republicans, Democrats, and the individual states?",652,0.89,760,1737737251,PoliticalDiscussion

V-Matic_VVT-i,To what extent was losing in 2020 a blessing in disguise for Trump and MAGA?,"Losing the 2020 election might have been a blessing in disguise for Trump and MAGA, as they are as powerful as ever in the GOP and the country. The 2020 election was closer than expected, and if Trump had won 100,000 more votes in four swing states, he would have won a second consecutive term.

When Trump unexpectedly won in 2016, he and the MAGA movement were relatively weak within the GOP and had no plan for government. Therefore, the GOP establishment subcontracted the cabinet, many legislative proposals, and judicial nominees. Trump’s first cabinet included Mike Pompeo, Jeff Sessions, Bill Barr, and John Bolton. Paul Ryan drafted the laws that Trump enacted, such as the tax cuts. Mitch McConnell and the Federalist Society handpicked the judicial nominees.

If Trump had won in 2020, there would have been no January 6 moment where those Republicans disloyal to Trump, such as Liz Cheney, Adam Kinzinger, Mitt Romney, as well as the other never-Trumpers, were excommunicated from the party. This would mean that MAGA's influence in the GOP had some opposition. Additionally, Trump would not have been under criminal investigation in several jurisdictions which fired up the base. More importantly, Trump had four years to plan for government this time; see Project 2025 and Agenda 47.

Additionally, Trump would have presided over the post-COVID inflation surge; hence, the GOP may have struggled in 2022 and lost the presidency in 2024 (Trump would have been term-limited hence the GOP nominee would have been someone else). This may have been the moment when the establishment Republicans took back control of their party from MAGA.

Now, the GOP is firmly under Trump’s and MAGA's control. Additionally, Trump’s ban on social media after January 6 indirectly led to Musk buying Twitter. Big tech has shifted in favour of Trump, which may not have happened if Trump had won in 2020.

So, to what extent was losing in 2020 a blessing in disguise to Trump and the MAGA movement?",208,0.86,203,1737673093,PoliticalDiscussion

Anyways I’m genuinely curious and want to know what my fellow Conservatives think. What’s the point of Trump negotiating a peace treaty in Ukraine if he doesn’t plan on America doing anything in any case? You would assume if America’s negotiating we’d be somewhat involved be it with sending troops to help administer a neutral zone or to guarantee Ukraine post-war but Trump has stated he does not intend for America do either or increase aid for Ukraine if the deal fails. If this is the case why even bother negotiating if we’re not going to get involved no matter the outcome? For the sake of being world-police? Also why should Ukraine accept any deal they view unfavorable now if they know the U.S. won’t support them even if they did sign the deal and why would Russia accept a deal if they know America won’t aid Ukraine anymore even if they don’t end the war? I just don’t see any point in Trump negotiating if America doesn’t have any involvement on the outcome, either just pull out and let them deal with it or actually have America involve itself in the outcome.

Anon_2425,Is this really a justifiable cut?,"I've been on board with cuts and investigation the Trump administration has been doing.. but I'm having a hard time understanding how this one is helpful. I'm heartily in favor of funding scientific research. This is limiting lab and equipment expenditures, a necessary part of that research. 

I'm not saying there aren't issues with the NIH that should be addressed. For one, there's loads of studies that we fund and the results arent made public. Publicly funded research should be required to be published. But this isn't addressing that. 

If there's corruption, or conflict of interest issues, wouldn't requiring greater transpiracy of funds be the solution? And firing those that abuse it? Not this? 

If its that we don't want to waste money on pointless studies, wouldn't a crack down and more clarified policy on what research can be funded be the solution?

The only other argument I've seen is that universities are cutting themselves a portion of this money. But do we know that, and if so, how? I've seen a couple of comments on YouTube videos from people allegedly in university administration positions saying the funds from the grants are razor thin and well accounted for. Not a very official source, I know -- where else can I look into that?

Does anyone have a good argument in favor of this?",52,0.7,45,1739775008,Republican
MikeyPh,New Rules and Changes - And Brief Explanations,"We have 2 new rules that may be consolidated or adjusted. You'll have to excuse my boomerishness, but with New Reddit and some other changes (I still prefer Old Reddit) some of what we used to do has shifted. Some of these thing I think can be coded, but I am learning how. Again, forgive my ignorance.

Anyway, one major problem that we have had in the past is that videos, text posts, and image posts, if unchecked, were often troll posts that not only meant to mock us, but also intended to get us shut down. If some bad actors on alt accounts created racist memes to throw on our sub and we weren't diligent enough in taking them down, the sub could get shut down. 

That is why we only allowed article posts from the subs inception, and it remained an unspoken rule. But things started shifting and there were little changes to posts that reddit made, and then new reddit happened and we mods just didn't adjust to the times perhaps? That's my excuse anyway.

People started posting links in text posts, which I thought was a mistake and we tried to correct it, but it was just a pain in the ass. They started posting text commentary under articles, which never used to happen.

So the issue is thus: too little oversight into posts leads to

* Shit posts (And I mean shit)
* Trolls having too easy a time to troll
* Bad actors using bad posts to try and get us shut down or promote brigading that just ruins the experience of our users.

These new rules are to force commentary where it belongs, in the comment section. If you want to make a comment about your article, just make it in the comment section, don't change the title to comment on an article, and don't comment on the article in any body section (I think I changed that so you won't be able to).

**Forcing the commentary into the comment section allows you users to protect from the problems that that causes while allowing for the** ***same*** **commentary**. So do not complain about free speech on this front. Protestors have to follow rules, too, they are supposed to get permits, they are not allowed to just disrupt everything... at least anywhere other than blue cities.

This also prevents an annoying trend I've been seeing where users post a link to Google. Not a Google article. Not some app on Google to comment on the app in some relevant way, just posting a link to Google so that they can then make a comment in what becomes a text post.

Hopefully I have removed that ability so the rule is moot.

We also hope to allow more things like text posts, video posts, and other posts. But that requires moderation. I can't tell you how many times such posts in the past were used to troll, brigade, and try to hurt us. An innocuous photo of Trump and the First Lady one posted here had a photoshopped silhouette of the twin towers on fire in the patter of Melania's dress or Trump's tie (I forget which). It was a troll post.

There may be setting changes to do some of this automatically (and I think there are, but I'm new to this part of moderating) so the rule doesn't even matter because it won't be possible to break these rules.

That said, I would also like you to know WHY we limit the kinds of posts we allow.",15,0.75,0,1739754433,Republican

Before the testosterone treatment, we found that weakly affiliated Democrats had 19% higher basal testosterone than those who identified strongly with the party (p=0.015). When weakly affiliated Democrats received additional testosterone, the strength of their party fell by 12% (p=.01) and they reported 45% warmer feelings towards Republican candidates for president (p &lt; 0.001).  Our results demonstrate that testosterone induces a “red shift"" among weakly-affiliated Democrats.  This effect was associated with improved mood.  No effects were found of testosterone administration for strongly affiliated Democrats or strong or weak Republicans.

MikeyPh,Clarification on what Anti-Republican means - Also just some tips on being decent.,"I covered leftist talking points in the last announcements (and I'll take that down once it seems the leftists, trolls, and bots have abated for the time being), but I wanted to discuss what it means to break our anti-Republican rule, along with our Reagan's 11th Commandment rule... because they are basically the same rule.

I'm going to go through some common complaints we get from banned users and how to avoid being banned like those users.

-**I was just stating a fact. What, FACTS aren't allowed anymore??**

Facts are allowed. They have always been allowed and even encouraged. But if your fact is laced with commentary, then it is not longer ""just a fact"". Here are some examples.

* **Fact**: The sky is blue.

* **What gets you banned**: The sky is blue, you fucking fascist.

Take note, because many do not notice the subtle difference between these two comments. Many who write something similar to the second comment will frequently in modmail say ""I was just stating a fact!"" This is so common, it's not funny.

Here's another one:

* **Fact**: Musk and Trump are uncovering a lot of fraud. While mistakes are being made, they are also being corrected, and Musk only has the power to report findings, not make final decisions.

* **What will get you banned**: Musk and Trump, man... these guys are running amok. I'm deeply concerned about how Musk is just firing people.

Do you see the difference? One is a fact, one is commentary and kind of half fact and half untruth. Many users do not see the difference. Be a user who does.

-**Just because I don't suck Trump's dick means I'm anti-Republican! I have been registered Republican for [X number of] years!**

This is one we get a lot. You must understand that we are a large umbrella. There are MAGA Republicans. There are Trump supporters who love Trump for this time in history but want to see leadership arise that is a bit more conventional as a leader and a bit easier for moderates to swallow. There are Republicans who absolutely hate the current president and the direction of the party.

We don't care what category you fall under. What we care about is that you show deference to fellow party members.

If you don't like the memes of Trump, fine, but don't trash people who do. And if you think it makes us look bad, I would just point out that the left has called us racists and bigots for literally decades and we took it in stride. They memed us in the media constantly before memes were even a thing.The character assassination attempts they did to Trump, they also did to Romney, to McCain, to Bush Jr., to Bush Sr., they accused Clarence Thomas of rape just like Kavanaugh. This is the left's M.O. and it has been for longer than I've been alive, arguably since before the Civil War.

You don't have to like the memes President Trump posts or that we on the right are making and posting. I don't particularly like them myself. But to trash fellow Republicans for it, without giving any understanding to the fact that the left have memed us and called us racists and bigots for decades, is disrespectful to your fellow Republicans.

You can argue it makes us look bad. But do so with respect.

* **What's acceptable**: I don't like this meme and doesn't think it helps our cause, but I can see why people find it funny and find it to be a valid answer to what the left has done to us for decades.

* **What's not acceptable**: The MAGA's who suck Trump's dick love this shit, but it makes us look bad.

*I would say to all the users who worry about looking bad to the left*: I know you care about looking bad to the left, but how about looking bad to your fellow party? Comments like the one just above make YOU look bad to ME and many of your fellow Republicans.

Show respect.

-**[Insert Prominent Republican's Name] is a piece of shit! He's a traitor to the party!**

I am a Christian first, a member of my family second, an American third, and a Republican lower on the list. I hope all of your have a similar hierarchy. Political parties are not the be-all and end-all. 

Political parties are tools to pool votes in a coalition to create a platform that a large number of people with many varying views can get behind and vote for in the face of another party that is doing the same with views we largely disagree with. They have value in the situations, but I kind of hate that they exist.

That said, being a sub FOR the party (although we are not affiliated with the GOP in any official capacity, we are just fellow Republicans), we do need to show deference to the party, we need to respect the party, we need to respect the umbrella, and we need to respect the individuals in the party.

I am not a fan of Romney but I respect that he is a Republican. So if I criticize him, I might have a little fun, but I won't just trash him. **Keep in mind, would you rather the left win, or have a [insert Republican you don't like]?** In my case, I'd rather have a Romney than an Obama.

* **What is acceptable**: Romney doesn't feel all that Republican to me these days and I really don't like how he keeps breaking from Republicans on so many issues, to the point I'd call him a RINO. But he's a strong business man and I'd take him over Obama any day.

* **What is not**: Fuck that loser Romney. He's a RINO piece of shit. I don't trust him.

Do you see the difference? One way criticizes while showing solidarity with the party, the other way is making it difficult to have any solidarity because it's so disrespectful.

We need solidarity. That does not mean we accept ""traitors"" if indeed we have any, but that does mean that we do not treat our fellow Republicans like crap. We don't throw them to the wolves unless it is clear we must. We don't cast them aside unless the allegations against them are credible. If they are indeed a RINO, show the receipts, but be respectful.

Matt Gaetz is a prime example. The right thing to do was to cut ties with him, but not before allegations were credible enough (especially knowing the left has made so many false accusations before). And also it should be done with the understanding that a lot of senators and congressman of all parties have likely been in a similar situation but just haven't been caught. He shouldn't have done what he seems to have done and it's inexcusable, but it also seems like a political targeting. Both of those things can be true at the same time.

We don't jump down a Republican's throat at the first accusation of impropriety, we let the facts come out and then deal with it appropriately. Getting hysterical about it from the first moment would lead to us not having Clarence Thomas or Brett Kavanaugh on the bench. We wouldn't have Trump. And think about how many it worked on. It worked on Romney, it worked on Bork (look him up), it worked on so many others. This is the left's MO. They tried to get rid of Hegseth because of a tattoo and baby clothes. Don't buy their hysterics, let the facts come out.

I hope this clears things up.",21,0.63,36,1739716273,Republican

We should be demanding answers on how this type of spending was allowed to go on for years and, in some cases, DECADES. Trump turned the spotlight on these corrupt politicians and they are scurrying around like the cockroaches that they are. Democrats and Republicans. WE DEMAND ANSWERS AND REPERCUSSIONS!!!!! Watergate was a grain of sand compared to this mountain of a scandal. The worst part is that so many are listening to the left's chants and falling for it when the evidence is right there in black and white!!!!!! We need to DEMAND that those responsible and/or complicit in this scandal are punished criminally and civilly. Ask why a politician making $174,000 a year becomes a multimillionaire in 5 years.

MikeyPh,Do Not Feed The Trolls and Leftists - a Few points to remember in this Strange and awesome time,"First of all, we are being inundated, just like every time Trump wins or is impeached, or is shot at, by trolls, by curious left leaning folks, and I assume by bots.

**Do not engage them. Report them.** I have seen too many posts or comments upvoted that a republican wouldn't upvote, or at least they wouldn't if they knew what was happening with that comment.

I just banned a user who came in saying something that SEEMS righteous, but was an underhanded trashing of the right. ""We shouldn't label or call the left names, that is leading to divide."" It sounds kinda nice, civility is important. None of us want war or violence or anything of the sort. But to come in here and act as if we are the uncivil ones indicates to me that you are either

* a lefty posing as a Republican to bullshit us and try to underhandedly sway us in a pathetic, passive aggressive way
* a Romney-esque Republican who has appeased the left far too much over the years while criticizing his own party far too much as well
* or a Republican who doesn't have any idea how bad the USAID stuff is because you are listening far too much to media that has largely been coopted by the Democrats.

By the way, we do expect our users to be civil, but we also give our users some latitude in our sub because this is our place to discuss politics with fellow republicans. I would not expect people in the democrat subs to refrain from referring to us in derogatory ways. But still, there are lines, and if our users cross them, we will ban them.

Folks, we try really really hard not to draw lines and define what a Republican is. The party is a large umbrella. There are libertarian republicans, there are republicans who are very conservative socially, there are republicans who are gay. There are Republicans who believe in abolishing the Fed, and ones who just want to reform it. There are republicans who are Muslim, Asian, black, hispanic even trans. And I have to give a special 'thank all' to all those minorities for voting Trump. It is so hard to go against the stranglehold the Democrats have had on minority voters for so long, I can't imagine how it feels to vote Trump when your whole family and everyone around you is saying you're a traitor or something. But you had the courage of your convictions and that is amazing.

There is room in the Republican party for so much. We are a huge umbrella.

That said, we have to draw the line sometimes. There are obvious lines. Like if you are a Republican Socialist.... sorry, you are not a Republican. I don't even care if you're legally registered republican. Socialists do not fit under our umbrella. We will ban you for espousing those views here.

If you are for mutilation of minors and are technically a republican, we will ban you for espousing those views here.

We have a rule that says ""No leftist talking points"" and we have that not because we are scared of leftist views (I mean look at how hard leftist views are failing ALL OVER THE WORLD... they're bad ideas). We have that rule because Reddit is 90% left and we hear their views all the time. There views are inescapable. We couldn't live in a bubble on reddit if we tried. I was just blasted on a design sub because someone posted what they thought was a clever design and it was basically a ""Trump is Hitler"" sign and I said ""Can this sub of all subs be non-political? Is that possible?"" I wasn't banned but I was told that when fascists aren't endangering our rights, then maybe they wouldn't HAVE to get political. Such wieners.

This leads to another reason for that rule. We were largely forced out of the ""neutral"" spaces long ago. Subs like r/politics, r/news, r/worldnews. They are all run by leftists, and they are swarming with leftists who will down vote and berate anyone who comes in with even just a mildly conservative or pro-Republican idea (or in my case just a pro-neutrality comment). So we were largely forced out except for those ""Republicans"" who the hardcore leftists like because they say things that the lefties think are reasonable.

If you are a ""Republican"" who blames us for the bad rhetoric when for over 40 years we have been called Racists, Nazis, and bigots and for much of that time we took it in stride, then you are so deluded, you are not a Republican and we can't have you here because you are espousing leftist talking points.

If you are a ""Republican"" who blames us for the tension when we were being skipped over by FEMA for supporting Trump, then you are not a Republican and we can't have you here. You'll be banned for leftist talking points.

If you are a ""Republican"" who says ""Hey guys, let's chill and stop saying the Democrat party is corrupt as hell for using the FBI to target our candidates, for using the IRS to target conservatives, for pressuring their buddies in banking to not do business with conservatives, for using USAID to funnel money to the Democrats, for using the presidency to garner favor with China, for getting their buddies in big tech to censor us for challenging the Covid narrative (which we were literally right about on every count), for supporting and funding the BLM riots which destroyed so many small business and property"" then you are not a Republican and we can't have you here. Those are leftist talking points. And they are also absurd.

We consider people who blame us for the tension to be anti-Republican and spewing leftist talking points. But we do understand that some on our side do not help the situation. We will ban those who do so dangerously, but will we not ban people for using the typical names we call the lefties in our circles.

We don't expect users to lavish Republicans with praise, you can disagree with Republicans, you can call out Republicans for wrong doing, but do so with respect to your fellow republicans. And for Pete's sake, do not paint a false equivalency that the left and right are just as bad right now.

I would ask our users again to help us by reporting those users and calling them out.

Many of them will have comments that are upvoted because the lefties love swarming our sub, especially when they have so soundly been beaten.",163,0.69,118,1739315071,Republican

CaptPotter47,Canada? Why?,"Canada?? Why?

For several months Trump has floated the idea that Canada should join the USA as the 51st state. 
So let’s set aside the fact that Canada will never willingly do that. 

But is it actually a good idea? 

The population of Canada is just north of 40M, which is more than Cali. So adding them would give them more state representatives than Cali currently has and they would likely be mostly Democrats. If the House stayed at 435, that would mean that most states would lose representatives and some republicans would likely be replaced by Democrats. So this would make it harder for a Republican house to exist given how tight the House is right now. 
Same thing on the Senate. They would likely elect 2 DEM Senators, and again making it harder for GOP to hold the Senate. 
Now if they up the Reps that will make the GOPs situation worse since most of the new Reps would be DEMs. So instead an even(ish) split in the house, we might just have 40 new DEM and 10 new GOP reps. 

But we probably wouldn’t be adding Canada as one large state. It would make more sense to add each province as a state. Which wouldn’t affect the Representatives much, but would widely swing the Senate DEM. Given that the 20 new Senators would like be 15 DEM to 5 GOP or similar. 

Trump trying to take ownership of Canada doesn’t make answer sense if he wants to keep the Republican Party alive, let alone the MAGA republicans. 

I want to be clear, this isn’t AntiTrump, I’m just trying to figure out why we would do this given that it would likely swing the political pendulum to the Democrats, and possibly for a long time. ",26,0.75,58,1739215692,Republican

Musk has been tasked with slashing government costs by leading the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), which is not an official government department

Some of Doge's moves are the subject of lawsuits, most recently after an attempted takeover of secure systems at the Treasury Department

Trump allies and Democrats have been doing the rounds on US morning television, and Doge has been the major talking point

coinfanking,GB News: Britain needs DOGE: How Elon Musk is cutting billions in waste including a Sesame Street play in Iraq,"
Nigel Farage is looking on in envy at Washington DC.

In Donald Trump’s first two-weeks as President he began a programme of mass deportations, cut billions in government waste, leveraged tariffs on Mexico and Canada, removed top FBI officials, ended DEI in the federal government, and fired tens of thousands of government bureaucrats.

Stephen K Bannon, an ally of the President, described this period as “days of thunder”. To many conservatives, President Trump has done more for their cause in two-weeks than a string of top Republican politicians have achieved in two-decades. One of the most successful initiatives has been the creation of the Department for Government Efficiency, known as DOGE, led by Elon Musk. Musk claims to have cut more than a billion dollars in spending every day, and has taken aim at various taxpayer-funded programmes, in particular those promoting diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI).

If the coming weeks unfold as they have since Trump’s inauguration, then no American president since Franklin D. Roosevelt’s legendary first 100 days has done more to reshape the nation.

Since the birth of the welfare state and FDR’s transformative expansion of the US government in the 1930s—marked by his controversial “alphabet agencies” aimed at revitalising the economy after the Great Depression—conservatives and libertarians have continuously fought against this revolution, championing small government instead. And ever since the 1930s the size of the government has only ever gone in one direction: It has grown. This was true under Democrat and Republican Presidents alike, including Ronald Raegan, and Donald Trump in his first term.

The government has become so bloated that the US national debt has reached $36.22 trillion, with its annual deficit standing at a whopping $1.8 trillion. Elon Musk has pledged to cut “trillions” in waste and fraud, a lofty goal which will be difficult to reach. However, the Tesla CEO has already identified billions spent on programmes he says are surplus to requirement. These include the tens of billions spent on USAID to projects around the world, some of which are absurd.

Among the projects funded by American taxpayers via USAID are: $20 million for a Sesame Street show in Iraq, $70,000 for a DEI musical in Ireland, $2 million for Moroccan pottery classes, and $6 million to promote tourism in Egypt. DOGE has already cut down the agency’s employees from more than 14,000 to just hundreds of critical staff, and Trump has tweeted promising to shut down the entire department.

DOGE operates with Elon Musk at its head and a series of young men underneath him. Musk has 20 staff operating in DOGE, most of whom are men in their early 20s, including one who is just 19.

These men are equivalent to Dominic Cummings’ “misfits and weirdos” who worked in Number 10 during Boris Johnson’s premiership. Musk believes he can hire autistic geniuses to work day and night to go through the federal budget with a knife. The team is using AI algorithms to search for waste, which is surely required when one takes into account the size of US government spending. One member of the team won a prestigious prize (worth hundreds of thousands of dollars) for using AI to translate ancient Roman texts which were previously believed to be unreadable. They have the political backing of the President and his Cabinet, as well as much of Congress. For the first time since the New Deal there seems to be a Republican President who meant it when he said he wanted a smaller, more efficient state.",37,0.76,5,1739137218,Republican

EarlOfEther,Civil discussion; What did Biden do wrong?,"Liberal here. I’m looking for a civil and respectful discussion without the insults and name calling.

There’s been many instances where I’ve seen people, presumably conservative/MAGA/republican, comment on posts that Biden has screwed up the country or how badly he has done. However, they never elaborate on what they think was so bad. 

From my perspective I think he did a good job overall. As with every president I’d say he handled some things were very well and some were very disappointing, but overall he was good. Just real quickly the very good things, in my opinion, were his economic recovery after COVID, curbing inflation, handling Ukraine, infvesting in infrastructure, and green initiatives. Very bad was the Afghanistan exit strategy and an overly aggressive strategy to move towards electric vehicles. 

I find Israel and Gaza/Hamas very complicated and I honestly can’t speak with confidence about either side, but I do feel Israel had/has the right to defend themselves. Meanwhile a lot of innocent Palestinian civilians and children suffered needlessly.

There were issues raised during the pandemic about offshoring our banking and accounting over concerns of national security.

Sanctions have been imposed on the ICC for targeting the US and its allies, the document says.

The world's only museum dedicated to the history and culture of the Gulf of Mexico may be in hot water following Trump's decision to change the name of the planet's largest gulf.

Last year Karen Poth decided it was time to rename the museum she runs in Mobile, Alabama, to better reflect its unique status.

To do so, she first had to line up support from elected officials and her board of directors before raising money for the project. Next, she needed to update the museum's website, logo and printed materials. Then in April 2024, she finally unveiled the new name in letters stretching 50ft across the eight-storey building: the National Maritime Museum of the Gulf of Mexico, the only museum in the world dedicated to the history, folklore and culture of the largest gulf on Earth.

So, imagine her response when US President Donald Trump recently announced that he planned to rename the body of water to the south of the US from the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America. ""My personality is to laugh,"" Poth said. ""Or else you cry.""",0,0.5,0,1738880981,Republican

BarzyBear,Why are all these immigration protests calling out the Executive Office?,"I find it ironic that all of these immigration protests are specifically against the Executive Branch. The Executive Branch is just enforcing the laws that are on the books, specifically Title 8. 

If people want to change the laws on the books, why are they not protesting against the House of Representatives? The House is the branch that is charged with writing bills into law, so if people want to change the laws, they should be protesting against the Legislative Branch. 

Additionally, why were there no protests against Obama when he was President? Obama deported 409,849 in 2012 alone. His administration deported more people in one term than Trump did in his first term. 

To me, if there is so much momentum for immigration reform (which I agree that there should be reform) why is no one holding up signs calling out their local Congressman or Congresswoman?  This is an ideal time for Congress to use the support of the people to put forth a meaningful immigration reform law. 

The last meaningful immigration reform was passed in 1996, which is almost 30 years ago. If people really wanted change they should step up and have Congress amend the law to reflect their opinions. Seems like common sense to me and is long overdue.

US President Donald Trump and Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have just hosted a joint news conference at the White House

Trump suggested the US could ""take over"" Gaza and ""do a real job"" by removing unexploded bombs and economically redeveloping the Palestinian territory into ""the Riviera of the Middle East""

The US president proposed that Palestinians could be resettled outside of Gaza while it was rebuilt, though countries throughout the Middle East have previously rejected this proposal

Netanyahu - the first foreign leader to visit in the US president's second term - said Trump's plan was an idea ""worth paying attention to""

The BBC'S Diplomatic Correspondent Paul Adam's writes the US president ""continues to startle everyone with his proposals for Gaza"", calling it ""head-spinning stuff""

Trump also said Iran ""cannot have a nuclear weapon"" and it would be ""unfortunate"" if Tehran thought it could develop atomic bombs

Netanyahu tells his host he is ""the greatest friend Israel has ever had"" - the two leaders were close allies during Trump's first term, when he relocated the American embassy to Jerusalem, a move that Palestinians condemned",32,0.79,38,1738720226,Republican

Liberals are literally the most sad and pathetic people on the planet, I genuinely hope some of them are trolling, because the other reality them being incredibly stupid, is terrifying.

AzureWra1th,What is up with people trying to justify vandalism and crime under the pretense of not supporting Elon/trump?,"I am so confused. Is he arguing to disprove his own argument, or call me an idiot? Because it feels like he is doing both. 

What kind of logic is this to vandalize someone’s property, and to draw conclusions out on me (calling me a Nazi) thats based on me defending a belief that it’s unfounded to vandalize the property of 1. Someone you don’t know, 2. Purely because you don’t like the owner of the company that creates a car you don’t like.
 
On top of that, the person in the video is sacrificing their own well being by doing what they did. You can clearly see their reflection- they  are not wearing any sort of gear that could prevent recognition of them. By this, I mean, they vandalize a car that has active security monitoring, and without any anti-identification gear, not even a full face mask? wtf? How can this possibly be agreeable or considered to be smart?

tomcat91709,The Media and Bad Parenting is the Problem,"Excerpt from one Rob Hetrick( stolen from Facebook)

""All you 'Latinos for Trump' are getting deported too!""  

Really?? You're that stupid?  Did you drop your brain into the toilet and forget to rinse it off before stuffing it back up your ass?  

Apparently this bit of ""wisdom"" flies in the face of something Liberals have been saying for years!  

ILLEGALS CAN'T VOTE

So how can a Latino who voted for Trump get deported if they're all US Citizens???

THEY CAN'T. 

I spoke to my barber this morning who said her college-aged Daughter came home frantically crying saying she needed to carry her birth certificate with her on campus because ICE was coming to college campuses and putting all brown people on buses.  She's a natural born US Citizen (her Mother is too, so she's not a Dreamer) who believes that Trump is deporting ALL Mexicans to Mexico!  

Can you believe that shit? Trump has not ended DACA!  Dreamers are not being deported!  US Citizens are certainly NOT being deported!  

Unless they are convicted criminals who have already served their jail time and are being protected by Sanctuary Cities that refuse to deport them.  

The shit that the Liberal media is putting out is outrageous.  The outright lies that the paid Liberal ""personalities"" on TikTok, Instagram, etc., are putting out is designed to keep these kids freaking the fuck OUT and reacting to one crisis after another without any let up.  That is literally how you radicalize someone!"" 

If you're a parent of a teenage or college age student and you're NOT sitting down with them and walking them through everything that is happening, YOU'RE the problem too!  It's our job to teach our kids how to be independent thinkers and how to apply critical thinking and objective reasoning! If you're not, maybe YOU should be deported!",0,0.39,0,1738433466,Republican

unannounced-insanity,Unpopular opinion,"What does everyone have in common? On the right or on the left, what do we have in common? We are not so different, despite what we are encouraged to believe. Are we not all scared, struggling to make a better life in this world, desperate to save a country we fear has taken one too many wrong turns? A world with ever increasing violence and limited resources? The challenge of making an honest living? Each side has very different opinions on how to solve the issues, but what is terrifying is how polarized it has become. Can we not all agree that the system is broken? Is that not what the right believes Trump is doing? He is shaking things up so that the old system that has failed so many is destroyed. The left is clinging to the broken system for the few scraps it still provided because frankly, is not the alternative also terrifying? A new way of government opens the door to big change, and not necessarily for the better. Sometimes power is seized by those that will not hold any value in the plight of the nations' citizens. 

Look, I don't know what is the right path forward. The only thing I know is that we as a people, a nation, need to come together. God says to love your neighbor. Jesus spent most of his time with the lowest of society. If God was in our hearts, would we not embrace our fellow human? If care for human rights was the motivating factor for opposing a political viewpoint, would we not also care for the human rights of those whose hearts seem filled with hatred? This horrific division between right and left is just distracting us all from the real systemic issues. We are all struggling to make a living, why can't we work together to solve the problem? Why must we villainize each other? We are all afraid. We all want a better country, a better government. We all want a voice. Why do we silence each other?

As we enter this new era of change, let us remember that for better or worse we are in this together. We cannot ignore the pain and suffering of one half of the country, even if you think they are stupid, intolerant, spiteful, sensitive, despicable, or blind. It does not change what is. The choice we do have is how we treat our fellow humans every day. Jesus was persecuted and ultimately killed. The entire time he kept his heart open to the people harming himself and his friends/followers. He did not perpetuate their hatred, and he loved them. God loves criminals, the sick, nonconformists, and those with hate filling their hearts. If you believe in God, follow his example. If you believe in human rights, make sure you don't play God and decide who is deserving of those rights. We are all in this together. ",0,0.5,11,1738251406,Republican

Interesting_Mix3133,I JUST WATCHED THIS VIDEO AND I HAVE QUESTIONS!!,"About history. So I watched this video and honestly it blew my mind and I encourage everyone to watch it. I have started to really be interested by history lately, and have been mind blown many times recently by how interesting we are as humans. 

The question: what do you do/feel when you learn a fact about history that changes how you see everything? Like it fills in gaps or context in a way that you either weren’t expecting or really even didn’t want to know or accept? I just feel an uncomfortable feeling of having been tricked, but not by any specific culprit to be upset at. And it feels like the “victor writes the history” thing is so prominent, and it feels like it was staring me right in the face so much the whole time. And I just really don’t know how to feel. 

You can watch the video if you’re interested (as I said, I highly recommend), but also, I’d like your thoughts on the question even if you don’t watch (oooo, or even comment, watch, and then come back and follow up, that’d be interesting), because the question itself is so interesting. And if you have other topics in history that made you feel this way, do explain!",8,0.68,4,1738213561,Republican

While I would like to see him succeed, especially after his vision for fixing the quality of American food and health, theres a decent chance that he wont get voted in.

coinfanking,Facebook owner Meta to pay Trump $25m to settle lawsuit over ban,"
US President Donald Trump has signed a settlement that is expected to see Meta pay him roughly $25m (£20m), sources familiar with the agreement told the BBC's US partner CBS.

Trump sued the Facebook and Instagram owner in 2021 over the suspension of his accounts after the 6 January Capitol riots that year.

In July 2024, Meta lifted the final restrictions on Trump's Facebook and Instagram accounts in the lead up to US presidential elections.

Around $22m of the settlement will go to a fund for Trump's presidential library, according to US media reports.

The balance will reportedly be used to cover legal costs and the other plaintiffs who signed on to the lawsuit. Meta will not admit wrongdoing.

The company suspended Trump's accounts in 2021 and said that it would ban him from the platforms for at least two years.

Twitter, which is now named X and owned by Trump ally Elon Musk, also ""permanently"" suspended the president from its platform.

After buying the firm for $44bn, Musk reinstated Trump's account in 2022 after a poll he ran on the site narrowly backed the move",137,0.84,27,1738201753,Republican

It’s another sign of the House GOP conference’s push for unity with Trump that the conference is being held at Trump National Doral, his golf course and resort near Miami.


Johnson told reporters on Monday that he expects to discuss several issues with Trump, including potentially conditioning wildfire aid to California. It comes after Trump suggested pairing aid to the liberal stronghold with a crackdown on noncitizen voting.


Trump has made no secret of his intent to keep a close eye on the Republican majorities in the House and Senate this year, particularly as they discuss how to use their numbers to pass a massive conservative policy overhaul via the budget reconciliation process.


By reducing the threshold for Senate passage from 60 votes to a 51-seat simple majority, reconciliation allows a party in control of both congressional chambers to enact sweeping changes, provided they’re relevant to budgetary and fiscal policy.


A copy of lawmakers' schedule obtained by Fox News Digital shows a heavy focus on reconciliation this week, with several closed-door meetings on the matter scheduled for Tuesday. 


Johnson also suggested on Monday that it could be a key part of Trump's speech as well.",29,0.7,2,1738018048,Republican

Magro18,Proof (DELETED BY REDDIT IN 2020) That January 6th Was Started by Antifa (See description ⬇️),"I have been scared to post this for years. I screen-recorded these videos to save them after seeing the bans on Donald Trump going up all over social media. These were originally posted just days after January 6th on the original Donald Trump Subreddit, which was later banned. All the evidence of election fraud and January 6th being orchestrated by Antifa was wiped. (Mind you, that Subreddit, which contained so much proof and content, was never reinstated.)  

When I saw platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Google banning and censoring content, I decided to keep these videos as a record for the future. Now, I am finally part of the silent majority brave enough to post this. This evidence should have been used in court. The frustration I feel when I think about how big tech and the media erased so much proof, silenced us, and painted us as villains is overwhelming.  

I compiled these videos taken by people on their phones during the January 6th Capitol ""insurrection."" You’ll see footage of people identifying Antifa members, following them, talking about them, and shouting at them as they broke windows, saying, “What are you doing?” and trying to stop them.  

I’ve also included videos of police officers appearing to guide people into the Capitol. Watching these, it’s hard not to wonder if the insurrection was started by no one but the left itself, orchestrating chaos while mindless MAGA supporters unknowingly walked into the trap. I’m posting this here so people can see for themselves and consider that maybe things weren’t as black and white as CNN and other left-leaning media make it seem.

coinfanking,Trump orders release of JFK and MLK assassination documents,"
US President Donald Trump has ordered the documents related to three of the most consequential assassinations in US history - the killings of John F Kennedy, Robert F Kennedy, and Martin Luther King Jr - to be declassified.

""A lot of people are waiting for this, for long, for, for decades,"" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Thursday. ""Everything will be revealed.""

President John F Kennedy was killed in 1963. His brother Robert F Kennedy was assassinated while running for president in 1968, just two months after King, America's most famous civil rights leader, was murdered in Memphis, Tennessee.

Many of the documents related to the investigations have been released in the years since, although thousands still remain redacted, particularly related to JFK.",22,0.75,1,1737676903,Republican

There’s no question that gas vehicles aren’t good for us, and I don’t believe in the whole climate change thing, but hybrid technology needed to be pushed more son than full EV.",0,0.47,19,1737660882,Republican
